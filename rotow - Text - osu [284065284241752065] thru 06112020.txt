SilentHarmony - Today at 4:14 PM
i do love a good conspiracy but one that we all know is real is that the world is actually flat
Sandstorm64 - Today at 4:14 PM
that's undoubtable
ever seen the horizon gauge on a plane
the horizon is always at the right angle
so the earth is flat
SilentHarmony - Today at 4:15 PM
lmao
i love flat earth
i think it is better
Sandstorm64 - Today at 4:15 PM
you ever played minecraft
and flown up real high
the ground doesn't curve
and gravity works there like real life its a hyperrealistic model
SilentHarmony - Today at 4:18 PM
i cant

[28-Apr-17 07:21 PM] Sandstorm64#5012
this is a question to the outdoor adventure group at mines:  You are at the top of a mountain. You see a bear slinking towards you out of the corner of your eye, and all you have is a Nalgene, extra tennis shoes, and a watch. How do you get down?

[28-Apr-17 07:21 PM] Sandstorm64#5012
I unlace one of the shoes and tie one end of the laces around the watch, I can use this to swing the watch at high speeds to potentially use as a means of hitting the bear in the nose/eyes to dissuade it from attacking me. I'll wet my finger to help identify what direction the wind is traveling and I'll try to skirt around the bear downwind. 
I'll pray to every god I can think of that the bear is a black bear as if it is I might stand a chance standing my ground and hitting it with my watch whip, water bottle, and extra shoe. I should be able to convince it to leave me alone by avoiding cornering it but persistently fighting it. If it's a grizzly bear God help me. I'll put my hands into the extra shoes and use them to assist my hands in covering the back of my head and neck laying still on the ground until it clearly loses interest.

[28-Apr-17 07:21 PM] joelovescash#8182
whats nalgene?

[28-Apr-17 07:21 PM] Sandstorm64#5012
a water bottle brand

[28-Apr-17 07:22 PM] Miles#3711
i give the bear the extra tennis shoes where it shall then proceed to thank me for the good service I have provided and then we become good friends

[28-Apr-17 07:22 PM] Miles#3711
grizzly situation avoided

[28-Apr-17 07:22 PM] Sandstorm64#5012
but what if its a black bear

[28-Apr-17 07:22 PM] Sandstorm64#5012
and the tennis shoes are white

[28-Apr-17 07:22 PM] Sandstorm64#5012
it might think youre racist

[28-Apr-17 07:23 PM] Miles#3711
i'll tell the bear to complain to the company that made the shoes

[28-Apr-17 07:23 PM] Miles#3711

[08-Jul-17 10:13 PM] fishamajig#0054
they seem like two different style games

[08-Jul-17 10:13 PM] fishamajig#0054
saw a subreddit about it and people were raving

[08-Jul-17 10:14 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
idk i just never played it because rougelikes kinda build up and Isaac just holds better than it

[08-Jul-17 10:15 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
also subreddits tend to overhype a lot of games

[08-Jul-17 10:15 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
but its still good

[08-Jul-17 10:16 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
I played it on a steam free weekend and enjoyed it

[08-Jul-17 10:17 PM] fishamajig#0054
it looks fun. i watched an hour long gameplay of it

[08-Jul-17 10:17 PM] Miles#3711
Nekopara is good

[08-Jul-17 10:17 PM] fishamajig#0054
also, once you buy a game on steam its transferrable right?

[08-Jul-17 10:17 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
in what sense?

[08-Jul-17 10:18 PM] fishamajig#0054
like if i build a new pc i can download the games on it instead

[08-Jul-17 10:18 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
yes

[08-Jul-17 10:18 PM] fishamajig#0054

[15-Jul-17 10:31 PM] Miles#3711

[15-Jul-17 10:31 PM] Miles#3711
One day he was lying on his bed

[15-Jul-17 10:31 PM] Miles#3711
Thinking

[15-Jul-17 10:31 PM] Miles#3711
"What shall I do today?"

[15-Jul-17 10:31 PM] Miles#3711
After that he got up

hi

[04-Aug-17 03:43 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
...

[04-Aug-17 03:43 PM] Miles#3711
Because alligators are a civilized folk

[04-Aug-17 03:43 PM] Miles#3711
Unlike the crocodiles

[04-Aug-17 03:43 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
dont make me drive over there and give you a heckin good whoopin

[04-Aug-17 03:44 PM] Miles#3711

[04-Aug-17 03:46 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
dont live in Louisiana

[04-Aug-17 03:46 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
then your croc problems be donezo

[04-Aug-17 03:47 PM] Miles#3711
Yeah

[04-Aug-17 03:47 PM] Miles#3711
I guess that's one thing

[04-Aug-17 03:47 PM] Miles#3711
But like

[04-Aug-17 03:48 PM] Miles#3711
You'll be moving farther away from the alligators

[04-Aug-17 03:48 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
that be true

[04-Aug-17 03:48 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
u know what we need to do

[04-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Miles#3711
kill all the floridians

[04-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
is re-enact harambe, but with crocodiles

[04-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
although your idea isnt bad at all

[04-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Miles#3711
hmm

[04-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Miles#3711
Why not both

[04-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
lets do it

[04-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Miles#3711
We make a baby crawl into a croc mouth

[04-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
üíØ

[04-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Miles#3711
Then someone shoots it

[04-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Miles#3711
Then we shoot everyone

[04-Aug-17 03:50 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
yes, perfect idea

[04-Aug-17 03:50 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
do u wanna steal the babies, or should I?

[04-Aug-17 03:50 PM] Miles#3711
Idk

[04-Aug-17 03:50 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
well we gotta get down to florida first

[04-Aug-17 03:51 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
i feel like this is a much good idea, very heckin amazin

[04-Aug-17 03:52 PM] Miles#3711
How do we get to Florida

[04-Aug-17 03:52 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
hitchhike with total strangers

[04-Aug-17 03:52 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
and befriend them

[04-Aug-17 03:53 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
then use them in our master plan

[04-Aug-17 03:53 PM] Miles#3711
What if we *somehow* find someone who's not onboard with the idea

[04-Aug-17 03:53 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
kill them

[04-Aug-17 03:53 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
and look for a new person to hitchhike with

[04-Aug-17 03:54 PM] Miles#3711
Wait

[04-Aug-17 03:54 PM] Miles#3711
We can take their car tho

[04-Aug-17 03:54 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
that true

[04-Aug-17 03:54 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
but it has to be a good car

[04-Aug-17 03:54 PM] Miles#3711
Hmm

[04-Aug-17 03:54 PM] Miles#3711
What counts as good

[04-Aug-17 03:55 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
not dragging on the road as we drive it

[04-Aug-17 03:55 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
not attracting suspicion

[04-Aug-17 03:55 PM] Miles#3711
What if some of the metal near the pedals is gone

[04-Aug-17 03:55 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
thats fine

[04-Aug-17 03:55 PM] Miles#3711
Like, rusted off

[04-Aug-17 03:55 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
i mean, as long as its not super noticable

[04-Aug-17 03:55 PM] Miles#3711
Fair enough

[04-Aug-17 03:56 PM] Miles#3711
Do we do this secretly

[04-Aug-17 03:56 PM] Miles#3711
Or guns blazing

[04-Aug-17 03:56 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
when we get to the zoo with the crocodiles,

[04-Aug-17 03:56 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
go all in

[04-Aug-17 03:56 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
but until then

[04-Aug-17 03:56 PM] Miles#3711
Like, there's a lot of floridians to get throufh

[04-Aug-17 03:56 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
secret

[04-Aug-17 03:57 PM] Miles#3711
Ok

[04-Aug-17 03:57 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
well i mean, theres gonna be a bunch at the beaches, so we can enact a Doofenschmirtz style tidal wave and kill them all

[04-Aug-17 03:57 PM] Miles#3711
I have an idea

[04-Aug-17 03:57 PM] Miles#3711
Ooh that's good too

[04-Aug-17 03:57 PM] Miles#3711
Hang on, I want your opinion on this approach

[04-Aug-17 03:57 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
that is

[04-Aug-17 03:57 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
100%

[04-Aug-17 03:58 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
lets get to cutting

[04-Aug-17 03:58 PM] Miles#3711
It would take a little longer tho

[04-Aug-17 03:58 PM] Miles#3711
Since we have to start in Alabama

[04-Aug-17 03:58 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
not if we hire workers for us

[04-Aug-17 03:58 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
then it'll get done in no time

[04-Aug-17 03:58 PM] Miles#3711
That's trus

[04-Aug-17 03:58 PM] Miles#3711
True

[04-Aug-17 03:58 PM] Miles#3711
Will we have to pay them

[04-Aug-17 03:59 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
they can get paid in the remnants of the floridians bank accounts

[04-Aug-17 03:59 PM] Miles#3711
Wait

[04-Aug-17 03:59 PM] Miles#3711
But how will we access those bank accounts l

[04-Aug-17 04:00 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
we'll say that we're their third cousins, and because they tragically disappeared, we need all their money to search for them

[04-Aug-17 04:00 PM] Miles#3711
Ooh

[04-Aug-17 04:00 PM] Miles#3711
That's good

[04-Aug-17 04:00 PM] Miles#3711
Oh wait

[04-Aug-17 04:00 PM] Miles#3711
Hang on, before we do anything

[04-Aug-17 04:01 PM] Miles#3711
And thus is important

[04-Aug-17 04:01 PM] Miles#3711
Will we have the support of the state of Georgia

[04-Aug-17 04:01 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
probably

[04-Aug-17 04:01 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
i get the feeling that they themselves want to end floridians

[04-Aug-17 04:02 PM] Miles#3711
That's true

[04-Aug-17 04:02 PM] Miles#3711
Is there a way to get Alabama on our side too

[04-Aug-17 04:02 PM] Miles#3711
I mean probably right

[04-Aug-17 04:02 PM] Miles#3711
Idk

[04-Aug-17 04:02 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
bribe them?

[04-Aug-17 04:03 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
im not sure, we'll have to do some research

[04-Aug-17 04:03 PM] Miles#3711
Uhh

[04-Aug-17 04:03 PM] Miles#3711
Hmm

[04-Aug-17 04:03 PM] Miles#3711
Oh what of we spare Mexicans and hand them to Alabama after

[04-Aug-17 04:03 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
that would be a good plan

[04-Aug-17 04:03 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
good thinking

[04-Aug-17 04:04 PM] Miles#3711
Would there be enough Mexicans tho

[04-Aug-17 04:04 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
i mean, we need enough to cut the entire state of florida

[04-Aug-17 04:04 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
so probablt

[04-Aug-17 04:04 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
probably*

[04-Aug-17 04:04 PM] Miles#3711
This is true

[04-Aug-17 04:04 PM] Miles#3711
Okay, I think we're good

[04-Aug-17 04:04 PM] Miles#3711
@DylanDoxsey @Will Doxsey what do you think

[04-Aug-17 04:05 PM] Miles#3711
Reenact harem bae with a croc

[04-Aug-17 04:05 PM] Miles#3711
Then kill Florida

Which of the following is NOT true about typical student alcohol consumption?
Most students drink heavily three or more days a week
Some students choose not to go to social gatherings where there will be a lot of drinking
People who get drunk often attract more attention to themselves, so it may seem like a lot of people are drinking heavily even if they aren't
Data about student drinking is gathered through anonymous student surveys and anonymous BAC testing of college students

Will and Dylan, you guys need to measure the width and length of the windows so that I can buy some curtains

This is over the week when you guys move into the triple

[17-Aug-17 09:18 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
so you guys need to bring a tape measure

[17-Aug-17 09:24 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
and you guys need to measure the inside dimensions (so the width of the inside; from the glass to the wall)

[17-Aug-17 11:03 PM] Miles#3711
when our brave hero will doxsey was making a sandwich

[17-Aug-17 11:03 PM] Miles#3711

slowly but surely the most amazing sandwich was being made rn

[17-Aug-17 11:04 PM] Miles#3711
but as the finishing touches were being made to it

[17-Aug-17 11:04 PM] Miles#3711
he hears a sudden knock on the door

[17-Aug-17 11:04 PM] Miles#3711

[17-Aug-17 11:05 PM] Miles#3711
"oh no"

[17-Aug-17 11:05 PM] Miles#3711

[17-Aug-17 11:05 PM] Miles#3711
devastated

[17-Aug-17 11:06 PM] Miles#3711
~~someone else continue this shit, i got nothing~~

[17-Aug-17 11:07 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

[17-Aug-17 11:08 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
and who stood there but lee harvey oswlad

[17-Aug-17 11:08 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

[17-Aug-17 11:10 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

[17-Aug-17 11:12 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
and  did 9/11 from afar

[17-Aug-17 11:12 PM] Miles#3711

[19-Aug-17 11:52 AM] Sandstorm64#5012
We were doing service projects around town today and we had to take the public bus

[19-Aug-17 11:53 AM] Sandstorm64#5012
Of course the bus passed us the first time so we had a lot of people waiting

[19-Aug-17 12:02 PM] Sandstorm64#5012
We loaded in and there were no seats left so we had to stand and we were packed tight

[19-Aug-17 12:03 PM] Sandstorm64#5012
This girl backed right up into me and I shifted to leave some room but any time the bus accelerated and braked people bumped around

[19-Aug-17 12:04 PM] Sandstorm64#5012
And I was like I am become bad anime protagonist

[19-Aug-17 01:11 PM] Miles#3711

ALEXANDRIA, Va. ‚Äì A federal grand jury returned an indictment today charging an El Salvadorian man with illegally reentry into the United States.

According to allegations in the indictment, Jose Amilcar De Leon Garcia, 44, was found in the United States on or about July 5, 2016, after having been removed on two separate occasions, and without having obtained the express consent of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security to reapply for admission to the United States.

[26-Aug-17 12:00 AM] Miles#3711

[26-Aug-17 12:00 AM] Miles#3711
little bobby had no idea who this man was

[26-Aug-17 12:00 AM] Miles#3711
so he took a gun and shot him in the face

[26-Aug-17 12:01 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
With such grace

[26-Aug-17 12:01 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
He shot his face to space

[26-Aug-17 12:01 AM] Miles#3711
and then out of nowhere

[26-Aug-17 12:01 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
Not to be replaced

[26-Aug-17 12:01 AM] Miles#3711

[29-Aug-17 07:36 PM] Miles#3711
Okay here we go

[29-Aug-17 07:36 PM] Miles#3711
the scenario:

[29-Aug-17 07:37 PM] Miles#3711
You and the gayest friend you have are both sitting next to each other on a plane

[29-Aug-17 07:37 PM] Miles#3711
suddenly the pilot's voice comes out on the intercom

[29-Aug-17 07:37 PM] Miles#3711
he says that there's a slight bit of turbulence

[29-Aug-17 07:38 PM] Miles#3711
as soon as he points this out, the whole plane starts shaking violently

[29-Aug-17 07:39 PM] Miles#3711
as it does, your friend pushes you to the ground and started trying to take off your pants

[29-Aug-17 07:40 PM] Miles#3711
you wonder why and as you do, you remember how he would "jokingly" say that he wanted to rape you before he died

[29-Aug-17 07:40 PM] Miles#3711
what do you do now

[29-Aug-17 07:48 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Fuck him so it would be consentual

[29-Aug-17 07:51 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

[22-Sep-17 11:22 AM] fishamajig#0054
but no room for an optical drive, will i want an optical drive?

[22-Sep-17 11:23 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
Depends

[22-Sep-17 11:24 AM] fishamajig#0054
i was thinking about it yeah

[22-Sep-17 11:24 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
and also limit to that amount of storage

[22-Sep-17 11:24 AM] fishamajig#0054

a sad feeling

[22-Sep-17 11:24 AM] fishamajig#0054
oh

[22-Sep-17 11:24 AM] fishamajig#0054
its true

[22-Sep-17 11:25 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Do u want to watch movies?

sadness just washed over me

[22-Sep-17 11:25 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
that are on dvd

[22-Sep-17 11:25 AM] Miles#3711
rip

[22-Sep-17 11:25 AM] fishamajig#0054
movies would be less of a concern for me

[22-Sep-17 11:25 AM] Miles#3711
i watch on cassette tapes

[22-Sep-17 11:25 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
physical games?

[22-Sep-17 11:25 AM] fishamajig#0054
i can always torrent or pirate

[22-Sep-17 11:25 AM] fishamajig#0054
probably not tbh

[22-Sep-17 11:25 AM] Miles#3711
emotional games

[22-Sep-17 11:25 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
u should b fine without one

[22-Sep-17 11:25 AM] Miles#3711

[22-Sep-17 11:26 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
u wont need a cd of windows either then

[22-Sep-17 11:26 AM] fishamajig#0054
it says there are 3 2.5" and 3 3.5" bays

[22-Sep-17 11:26 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
just a code

[22-Sep-17 11:26 AM] fishamajig#0054
those are ssd/hdd im assuming?

[22-Sep-17 11:26 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
ayes

[22-Sep-17 11:26 AM] fishamajig#0054
rad

[22-Sep-17 11:26 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
wat internals u want for it?

[22-Sep-17 11:27 AM] fishamajig#0054
well im not really sure what kind of graphics card or mobo ill want

[22-Sep-17 11:27 AM] fishamajig#0054
not too picky, basically i want it to be decent and relatively cheap

[22-Sep-17 11:27 AM] fishamajig#0054
but i dont want to play all my games in 144p

[22-Sep-17 11:27 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
r u planning on watercooling?

[22-Sep-17 11:27 AM] fishamajig#0054
1080 would be neat, maybe 1440

[22-Sep-17 11:28 AM] fishamajig#0054
down the road, maybe. for now, no

[22-Sep-17 11:28 AM] fishamajig#0054
unless i have the budget for it later

[22-Sep-17 11:28 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
watercooling is a little harder in small builds, but more practical

[22-Sep-17 11:28 AM] fishamajig#0054
yeah this one has room for a few fans but primarily uses 1

[22-Sep-17 11:29 AM] fishamajig#0054
and being in florida would be nice to watercool

[22-Sep-17 11:29 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
link it

[22-Sep-17 11:29 AM] fishamajig#0054
but for trvel purposes i dont think tsa would like liquid running through a pc

[22-Sep-17 11:29 AM] fishamajig#0054
https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QMp323/thermaltake-case-ca1d500s1wn00

[22-Sep-17 11:29 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
if its custom u can empty it out first

[22-Sep-17 11:29 AM] fishamajig#0054
oh okay

[22-Sep-17 11:29 AM] fishamajig#0054
or insttall it down here

[22-Sep-17 11:31 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
watercooling is also impractical for some cpus

[22-Sep-17 11:31 AM] fishamajig#0054
oh i see

[22-Sep-17 11:31 AM] fishamajig#0054
so i need to fnind a cpu first

[22-Sep-17 11:32 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
I would always recomeend starting a build by picking out the CPU first, because to pick it out you have to conside your cash, overall power level, and to do that you need to do research first that caomes in handy after.

[22-Sep-17 11:33 AM] fishamajig#0054
okay so for someone like me who would casually game, what kind of price range would you suggest>

[22-Sep-17 11:33 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
there are a lot of factors

[22-Sep-17 11:34 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
how much do astetics concern u?

[22-Sep-17 11:34 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Do u want it to be more powerful than consols, or only just as powerful?

[22-Sep-17 11:34 AM] fishamajig#0054
i dont see myself fully giving up my xbox

[22-Sep-17 11:35 AM] fishamajig#0054
so at least as powerful

[22-Sep-17 11:35 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
the point is that you cant just pick one you have to think out and research a lot more of your build

[22-Sep-17 11:35 AM] fishamajig#0054
if it can run a game like PUBG or CSGO without lag that would probably be the most intense i go

[22-Sep-17 11:35 AM] fishamajig#0054
okay i understand

[22-Sep-17 11:35 AM] fishamajig#0054
ill try and read up on factors

[22-Sep-17 11:36 AM] Miles#3711
Poob good

[22-Sep-17 11:36 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
if u want to just get a list of parts we can do that as well, but u will come out with less understanding and we will have to ask kind of vague questions and assume stuff

[22-Sep-17 11:37 AM] fishamajig#0054
nah i want to do this with guidance, not hav eyou do it for me.  this hopefully will be a learning experiene for me

[22-Sep-17 11:37 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
or me and will could try and teach u all the stuff when we have time

[22-Sep-17 11:37 AM] fishamajig#0054
it wont just be for gaems either ill make it my primary workstation, so microsoft word, adobe photoshop and shit

[22-Sep-17 11:38 AM] fishamajig#0054
i dont want to become a burden on you lads.  college amkes us all busy

[22-Sep-17 11:38 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
no I actually would really enjoy i

[22-Sep-17 11:38 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
it

[22-Sep-17 11:38 AM] fishamajig#0054
thats why im thinking christmas break, so i can kinda have more in person with you guys

[22-Sep-17 11:38 AM] fishamajig#0054
plus xmas money

[22-Sep-17 11:39 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
ya but i really would like to tech this stuff to people who care about it.

[22-Sep-17 11:39 AM] fishamajig#0054
then i would love to learn

[22-Sep-17 11:39 AM] fishamajig#0054
computers totally fascinate me

[22-Sep-17 11:39 AM] fishamajig#0054
and being able to say you built your pc would be a great feeling

[22-Sep-17 11:39 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
Hey, I'll probably have enough cash to build one by then as well

[22-Sep-17 11:40 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
it is

[22-Sep-17 11:40 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
i gtg to chem now tho

[22-Sep-17 11:40 AM] fishamajig#0054
we can build micros together

[22-Sep-17 11:40 AM] fishamajig#0054
okay thanks for the help lad

[22-Sep-17 11:40 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
np

[22-Sep-17 11:40 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
I'll stay

[22-Sep-17 11:40 AM] fishamajig#0054
so are you gonna go micro or mini

[22-Sep-17 11:40 AM] fishamajig#0054
or full tower

[22-Sep-17 11:41 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
Mini its

[22-Sep-17 11:41 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
Itx

[22-Sep-17 11:41 AM] fishamajig#0054
okay

[22-Sep-17 11:41 AM] fishamajig#0054
im leaning micro atx just cuz it seems like it can do more

[22-Sep-17 11:41 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
I have a build already completed

[22-Sep-17 11:41 AM] fishamajig#0054
oh cool

[22-Sep-17 11:41 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
A list

[22-Sep-17 11:41 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
Not money

[22-Sep-17 11:41 AM] fishamajig#0054
yeah lol

[22-Sep-17 11:42 AM] fishamajig#0054
thast the important part

[22-Sep-17 11:42 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
I have 2000 in cash at home, but I'm saving it for loans

[22-Sep-17 11:47 AM] fishamajig#0054
yeah i have about 5k in the bank but i need to make that last all 4 years here

[22-Sep-17 11:47 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
Same

[22-Sep-17 11:47 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
But I took some out to hide it from financial aid

[22-Sep-17 11:48 AM] fishamajig#0054
hahaha nice

[22-Sep-17 11:48 AM] fishamajig#0054
so im looking at my bank statements and apparently every month i get a deposit of 400

[22-Sep-17 11:59 AM] fishamajig#0054
as far as where i buy parts from, does it matter? i have amazon prime so that would be cheapest probably

[22-Sep-17 11:59 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
Ya

[22-Sep-17 11:59 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
Unless it's realy less money on newegg or somewhere else

[22-Sep-17 12:00 PM] fishamajig#0054
case aloe is less than 60 on amazon and 77 on new egg

[22-Sep-17 12:00 PM] fishamajig#0054
alone

[22-Sep-17 12:00 PM] fishamajig#0054
and im sure shipping and handling adds up

[22-Sep-17 12:00 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Ya

[22-Sep-17 12:01 PM] fishamajig#0054
so whats your opinion on the water cooling

[22-Sep-17 12:01 PM] fishamajig#0054
should i try to find a cpu thats compativble with it?

[22-Sep-17 12:03 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Water cooling is nice in a small case, but it realy isn't that much better unless you go for a custom water cooling.

[22-Sep-17 12:03 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Also if you don't over clock you should be good without water

[22-Sep-17 12:07 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
https://pcpartpicker.com/user/doxmonster/saved/CV4nnQ my list so far

[22-Sep-17 12:22 PM] fishamajig#0054
Is overclocking  something I should look into?

[22-Sep-17 12:23 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Depends on if you want to get better proformance for shorter lifespan

[22-Sep-17 12:23 PM] fishamajig#0054
Oh nah lifespan is good

[22-Sep-17 12:23 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Ya

[22-Sep-17 12:24 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
It's like I you have 3.4ghz and you want 3.8ghz

[22-Sep-17 12:28 PM] fishamajig#0054
Oh haha

[22-Sep-17 12:28 PM] fishamajig#0054
Not worth it imo

[22-Sep-17 12:29 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
It's not

[22-Sep-17 12:29 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
People are dumb

[22-Sep-17 12:29 PM] fishamajig#0054
Hahaha sounds cool tho. I have an overclocked cpu

[22-Sep-17 12:48 PM] joelovescash#8182
It'll be dope

[22-Sep-17 12:48 PM] fishamajig#0054
Hahaha

[22-Sep-17 12:48 PM] fishamajig#0054
Damn kid

[22-Sep-17 12:48 PM] joelovescash#8182
It's legal tho

[22-Sep-17 12:48 PM] joelovescash#8182
Agricultural tool

[22-Sep-17 12:48 PM] joelovescash#8182
Same as a machete

[22-Sep-17 12:48 PM] fishamajig#0054
Oh true that

[24-Sep-17 02:45 PM] fishamajig#0054
Would an Intel core i7 be overkill?

[24-Sep-17 02:46 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
7nth gen?

[24-Sep-17 02:46 PM] fishamajig#0054
7700

[24-Sep-17 02:47 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
I personally would say ya, but some people would say it is worth it

[24-Sep-17 02:47 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Depends on what you are planning to do

[24-Sep-17 02:47 PM] fishamajig#0054
i mean i know you went with an i3

[24-Sep-17 02:47 PM] fishamajig#0054
i just want it to be a fast processer

[24-Sep-17 02:48 PM] fishamajig#0054
the one on my laptop is an i7 7th gen

[24-Sep-17 02:48 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Depends on what you want for price to proformance

[24-Sep-17 02:49 PM] fishamajig#0054
i guess i5 would be fine

[24-Sep-17 02:49 PM] fishamajig#0054
integrated graphics card?

[24-Sep-17 02:53 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
What about integrated graphics?

[24-Sep-17 02:54 PM] fishamajig#0054
do i want a cpu with integrated graphics?

[24-Sep-17 02:54 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
No, get a graphics card

[24-Sep-17 02:55 PM] fishamajig#0054
https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QMp323/thermaltake-case-ca1d500s1wn00

[24-Sep-17 02:55 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
I think integrated graphics is on mobo

[24-Sep-17 02:56 PM] fishamajig#0054
these cpus have intel hd graphics 630

[24-Sep-17 02:57 PM] fishamajig#0054
and is hyperthreading something i want?

[24-Sep-17 02:58 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Ya

[24-Sep-17 02:58 PM] fishamajig#0054
so the i7 has that

[24-Sep-17 02:58 PM] fishamajig#0054
the i5 doesnt

[24-Sep-17 02:58 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
I think most cpus have hyperthreading

[24-Sep-17 02:58 PM] fishamajig#0054
https://pcpartpicker.com/products/compare/dQM323,VKx9TW/

[24-Sep-17 02:58 PM] fishamajig#0054
this is the link i meaent to send

[24-Sep-17 03:01 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Ok

[24-Sep-17 03:03 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Imo that's not worth the price on the i7

[24-Sep-17 03:04 PM] fishamajig#0054
the i5 is definitely more wallet friendly

[24-Sep-17 03:04 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Ya

[24-Sep-17 03:05 PM] fishamajig#0054
but even then do i need to go with the 7600K

[24-Sep-17 03:06 PM] fishamajig#0054
do the numbers following the i5 really make that much of a difference, like 7600K, 7500, 6400, etc

[24-Sep-17 03:06 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Download the app intel ARK

[24-Sep-17 03:06 PM] fishamajig#0054
iphone or computer

[24-Sep-17 03:07 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
It shows the differences in the cpus, iphone

[24-Sep-17 03:07 PM] fishamajig#0054
okay im on it

[24-Sep-17 03:08 PM] fishamajig#0054
higher gen is better yeah?

[24-Sep-17 03:08 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Ya

[24-Sep-17 03:08 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
No buy last gen

[24-Sep-17 03:09 PM] fishamajig#0054
last gen i7 or i5

[24-Sep-17 03:09 PM] fishamajig#0054
and last gen as in 6th not 7th or 5th not 6th?

[24-Sep-17 03:10 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Just avoid last gen cpus

[24-Sep-17 03:11 PM] fishamajig#0054
im confused stay away form last gen?

[24-Sep-17 03:11 PM] fishamajig#0054
like buy the newest gen?

[24-Sep-17 03:11 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Ya

[24-Sep-17 03:11 PM] fishamajig#0054
okay the app shows 6th gen as the newest

[24-Sep-17 03:11 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Get update

[24-Sep-17 03:12 PM] fishamajig#0054
okay

[24-Sep-17 03:12 PM] fishamajig#0054
8th gen?

[24-Sep-17 03:13 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Only for laptops

[24-Sep-17 03:13 PM] fishamajig#0054
and om looking for a core processor right?

[24-Sep-17 03:13 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Ye

[24-Sep-17 03:13 PM] fishamajig#0054
so 7th or 8th gen

[24-Sep-17 03:13 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Itel naming u =laptop

[24-Sep-17 03:14 PM] fishamajig#0054
oh okay

[24-Sep-17 03:14 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
There are no 8th gen desktop cpus

[24-Sep-17 03:15 PM] fishamajig#0054
4 core or 2

[24-Sep-17 03:15 PM] fishamajig#0054
im thinking 4

[24-Sep-17 03:16 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Gaming only needs 2, but content creation may need more

[24-Sep-17 03:16 PM] fishamajig#0054
ill probably use it for solidworks type software too

[24-Sep-17 03:17 PM] fishamajig#0054
like cad 3d modelling

[24-Sep-17 03:17 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
May need 4

[24-Sep-17 03:17 PM] fishamajig#0054
okay 4 it is

[24-Sep-17 03:17 PM] fishamajig#0054
obv higher freq is batter right

[24-Sep-17 03:17 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Yep

[24-Sep-17 03:17 PM] fishamajig#0054
now wattages are different

[24-Sep-17 03:18 PM] fishamajig#0054
65 vs 91

[24-Sep-17 03:19 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Just how much it will draw from your power supply

[24-Sep-17 03:19 PM] fishamajig#0054
will it mean i need to buy a bigger power supply?

[24-Sep-17 03:20 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Probably not, they usually go up by hundred watts

[24-Sep-17 03:20 PM] fishamajig#0054
okay cool

[24-Sep-17 03:20 PM] fishamajig#0054
so im looking at the i5 7600 and the 7600K

[24-Sep-17 03:20 PM] fishamajig#0054
and the K is faster

[24-Sep-17 03:20 PM] fishamajig#0054
but lacks a couple features

[24-Sep-17 03:21 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Wait

[24-Sep-17 03:21 PM] fishamajig#0054
and neither has hyperthreading

[24-Sep-17 03:21 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
K means overclockable

[24-Sep-17 03:21 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
That's why it's faster

[24-Sep-17 03:21 PM] fishamajig#0054
oh okay

Stock cooler all you need if you no overclock

[24-Sep-17 03:37 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
if not overclock not worth watercooling

[24-Sep-17 03:37 PM] fishamajig#0054
okay then

[24-Sep-17 03:37 PM] joelovescash#8182

[24-Sep-17 03:39 PM] joelovescash#8182
mobo doesnt matter 2  or 4

[24-Sep-17 03:39 PM] fishamajig#0054
intel i5 7500 or 7600

[24-Sep-17 03:39 PM] joelovescash#8182
oh

[24-Sep-17 03:39 PM] fishamajig#0054

[24-Sep-17 03:39 PM] fishamajig#0054
unless i7 is better

[24-Sep-17 03:39 PM] joelovescash#8182
depends what youre doing

[24-Sep-17 03:40 PM] joelovescash#8182
what are you doing?

[24-Sep-17 03:40 PM] fishamajig#0054
some gaming, but this will also become my workstation, so probably a lot of cad solidworks type stuff

[24-Sep-17 03:40 PM] fishamajig#0054
3d rendering and modelling

[24-Sep-17 03:40 PM] joelovescash#8182
google it

[24-Sep-17 03:40 PM] fishamajig#0054
and microsoft shit, adobe shit

[24-Sep-17 03:40 PM] joelovescash#8182
gaming doesnt need a powerful processor at all

[24-Sep-17 03:40 PM] joelovescash#8182
adobe stuff u need a decent processor

[24-Sep-17 03:41 PM] joelovescash#8182
adobe is horribly optimized

[24-Sep-17 03:41 PM] fishamajig#0054
im more concerned about the like photoshop/ lightroom, and solidworks

[24-Sep-17 03:41 PM] joelovescash#8182
gaming is all gpu

[24-Sep-17 03:41 PM] joelovescash#8182
other stuff is cpu based

[24-Sep-17 03:41 PM] joelovescash#8182
gpu sorta helps adobe, only really video things tho

[24-Sep-17 03:42 PM] joelovescash#8182
what gpu are you getting?

[24-Sep-17 03:42 PM] fishamajig#0054

[24-Sep-17 03:42 PM] joelovescash#8182
oh

[24-Sep-17 03:43 PM] joelovescash#8182

[24-Sep-17 04:32 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
dependson the other features of it

[24-Sep-17 04:33 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
like wifi, pcie slots, ect.

[24-Sep-17 04:39 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
i wouldnt go with one that has zero reviews tho

[24-Sep-17 04:39 PM] fishamajig#0054
yeah ik

[24-Sep-17 04:39 PM] fishamajig#0054
thats the thing

[24-Sep-17 04:40 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
I would say that wifi is good but bluetooth is honestly kinda unecessary

[24-Sep-17 04:40 PM] fishamajig#0054
ehh i guess

[24-Sep-17 04:40 PM] fishamajig#0054
i like bluetooth

[24-Sep-17 04:40 PM] fishamajig#0054
but i probably wont use it on desktop

[24-Sep-17 04:41 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
ya wat were u thinking with bluetooth?

[24-Sep-17 04:41 PM] fishamajig#0054
headphones

[24-Sep-17 04:42 PM] fishamajig#0054
but i susally plug in my bluetooth headphones anyway

[24-Sep-17 04:42 PM] fishamajig#0054
oh my xbox controller connects via bluetooth

[24-Sep-17 04:42 PM] fishamajig#0054
thats important

[24-Sep-17 04:42 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
I think it requires a specific dongle tho

[24-Sep-17 04:42 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
im not 100% sure about that tho

[24-Sep-17 04:43 PM] fishamajig#0054
nah not the new controllers

[24-Sep-17 04:43 PM] fishamajig#0054
built in bluetooth

[24-Sep-17 04:43 PM] fishamajig#0054
i use it with my laptop

[24-Sep-17 04:43 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
oh ok

[24-Sep-17 04:43 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
If u think its worth the extra money then go for it

[24-Sep-17 04:43 PM] fishamajig#0054
i mean its got good reviews to back it up

[24-Sep-17 04:44 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
ya so if u think the controller capabilities are worth the money it costs for it id do it

[24-Sep-17 04:44 PM] fishamajig#0054
i mean how much would a bluetooth adapter be

[24-Sep-17 04:45 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
idk honestly

[24-Sep-17 04:45 PM] fishamajig#0054
cuz having a controller is a gamechanger

[24-Sep-17 04:45 PM] fishamajig#0054
i might just go for it

[24-Sep-17 04:46 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
sure go for it

[24-Sep-17 04:46 PM] fishamajig#0054
rest of the stats look okay?

[24-Sep-17 04:47 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
id need to know the other parts in the build to judge that

[24-Sep-17 04:47 PM] fishamajig#0054
ill send you my complete build

[24-Sep-17 04:47 PM] fishamajig#0054
when im done

i know corsair and kingston

[24-Sep-17 04:52 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
best for price is kingston and crucial

[24-Sep-17 04:52 PM] fishamajig#0054
yeah i like kingston

[24-Sep-17 04:53 PM] fishamajig#0054
they make all sorts of data storage devices

[24-Sep-17 04:53 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

Doxseys, is my pc capable of utulizing display ports?

[24-Sep-17 09:24 PM] fishamajig#0054
if i do a dual monitor setup will i need a display port for each monitor?

[24-Sep-17 09:24 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
yeah i think so

[24-Sep-17 09:27 PM] joelovescash#8182
kids omg

[24-Sep-17 09:28 PM] joelovescash#8182
ur gpu will  have 4-5 ports

[24-Sep-17 09:28 PM] fishamajig#0054
nah ones i see have 2-3 display ports and only 1-2 hdmi

[24-Sep-17 09:28 PM] joelovescash#8182
usually hdmi and display port

[24-Sep-17 09:28 PM] fishamajig#0054
right

[24-Sep-17 09:28 PM] fishamajig#0054
so how many do i need

[24-Sep-17 09:28 PM] fishamajig#0054
one port per monitor?

[24-Sep-17 09:28 PM] joelovescash#8182
yah

[24-Sep-17 09:28 PM] joelovescash#8182
thats it

[24-Sep-17 09:28 PM] fishamajig#0054

[24-Sep-17 09:28 PM] fishamajig#0054
2 or 3 then?

[24-Sep-17 09:28 PM] joelovescash#8182
make sure its the same connection on the monitors

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] joelovescash#8182
yes

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] joelovescash#8182

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] joelovescash#8182
since thats defualt

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] fishamajig#0054
5 display ports?

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] fishamajig#0054
fuuuuk

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] joelovescash#8182
no just ports

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
chris does mine also utalize display ports as well?

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] joelovescash#8182
in general

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] fishamajig#0054
how many display vs hdmi

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] joelovescash#8182
as many as you want

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] fishamajig#0054
im talking about yours

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] joelovescash#8182
none of us have monitors that can use display port real well

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] joelovescash#8182
hdmi is plenty

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] fishamajig#0054
ohhh

[24-Sep-17 09:29 PM] fishamajig#0054
so 2 hdmi

[24-Sep-17 09:30 PM] fishamajig#0054
and however many displaty

[24-Sep-17 09:30 PM] joelovescash#8182
display port is super dank but overkill

[24-Sep-17 09:30 PM] joelovescash#8182
if you have displayport use it

[24-Sep-17 09:30 PM] joelovescash#8182
or not

[24-Sep-17 09:30 PM] joelovescash#8182
it doesnt matter

https://pcpartpicker.com/product/3bL7YJ/asus-geforce-gtx-1060-6gb-strix-video-card-rog-strix-gtx1060-o6g-gaming

[24-Sep-17 09:30 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
wait, but does mine allow for the use of display ports tho?

[24-Sep-17 09:30 PM] joelovescash#8182
bob ur fine

[24-Sep-17 09:31 PM] joelovescash#8182
whats ur card

[24-Sep-17 09:31 PM] joelovescash#8182
google it nate

[24-Sep-17 09:31 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
one sec

[24-Sep-17 09:31 PM] joelovescash#8182
if the card has display port openings then yes

[24-Sep-17 09:31 PM] fishamajig#0054
its the most expensive on the list

[24-Sep-17 09:31 PM] fishamajig#0054
but its the nicest

[24-Sep-17 09:31 PM] joelovescash#8182
then dont get it

[24-Sep-17 09:31 PM] joelovescash#8182
whatever you want

[24-Sep-17 09:31 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hjvwWX

[24-Sep-17 09:31 PM] fishamajig#0054
still its only like 350

[24-Sep-17 09:31 PM] joelovescash#8182
itll all work out anyways

[24-Sep-17 09:32 PM] joelovescash#8182
honestly you could get a better deal probably

[24-Sep-17 09:32 PM] joelovescash#8182
my 1070 was 390

[24-Sep-17 09:32 PM] joelovescash#8182
now 1080s are 480ish

[24-Sep-17 09:32 PM] fishamajig#0054
so what aare you saying

[24-Sep-17 09:32 PM] fishamajig#0054
go with a 1070

[24-Sep-17 09:32 PM] joelovescash#8182
you could

[24-Sep-17 09:32 PM] fishamajig#0054
for at this price level

[24-Sep-17 09:32 PM] joelovescash#8182
or get a cheaper 1060

[24-Sep-17 09:33 PM] joelovescash#8182
nate your card is fine

[24-Sep-17 09:33 PM] joelovescash#8182
3 dp and 1 hdmi

[24-Sep-17 09:33 PM] joelovescash#8182
plus a d-sub

[24-Sep-17 09:33 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
ok, how many does urs have?

[24-Sep-17 09:33 PM] joelovescash#8182

[24-Sep-17 09:33 PM] joelovescash#8182
same as that

[24-Sep-17 09:33 PM] joelovescash#8182
thats typical

[24-Sep-17 09:33 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
3 dp, I hdmi, and I d sub?

[24-Sep-17 09:33 PM] joelovescash#8182
i dont think there is a card with more than 5 ports

[24-Sep-17 09:33 PM] joelovescash#8182
yah

[24-Sep-17 09:33 PM] joelovescash#8182
thats what it said

[24-Sep-17 09:34 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
how much was urs chris?

[24-Sep-17 09:34 PM] joelovescash#8182
390

[24-Sep-17 09:34 PM] joelovescash#8182
for a gigabyte 1070

[24-Sep-17 09:34 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
sorry, i meant ur entire build

[24-Sep-17 09:34 PM] joelovescash#8182
oh... a bunch

[24-Sep-17 09:34 PM] joelovescash#8182
1900ish

[24-Sep-17 09:34 PM] joelovescash#8182
im not building for a long time again

[24-Sep-17 09:35 PM] joelovescash#8182
this will last at least 3 years or more

[24-Sep-17 09:35 PM] joelovescash#8182
probably more

[24-Sep-17 09:35 PM] joelovescash#8182
i hope

[24-Sep-17 09:35 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
is my build good?

[24-Sep-17 09:36 PM] joelovescash#8182
yah honestly save 100 bucks dont buy windows

[24-Sep-17 09:36 PM] joelovescash#8182
just download the iso from the microsoft website

[24-Sep-17 09:36 PM] joelovescash#8182
onto a usb and install from that

[24-Sep-17 09:36 PM] joelovescash#8182
you can use all of windows without activating it essentially

[24-Sep-17 09:37 PM] joelovescash#8182
if you found an ssd that would be a better use of the money

[24-Sep-17 09:37 PM] joelovescash#8182
have it for a boot drive speeds up the build soooo much

[24-Sep-17 09:39 PM] joelovescash#8182
cable management is a nightmare

[24-Sep-17 09:39 PM] joelovescash#8182
i had enough trouble with my oversized atx

[24-Sep-17 09:39 PM] fishamajig#0054

Do you think my build will last?

[24-Sep-17 09:39 PM] joelovescash#8182
yah for a while

[24-Sep-17 09:39 PM] joelovescash#8182
check out ssds tho

[24-Sep-17 09:40 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[24-Sep-17 09:40 PM] fishamajig#0054

[24-Sep-17 09:40 PM] fishamajig#0054
mini

[24-Sep-17 09:40 PM] fishamajig#0054

[24-Sep-17 09:40 PM] fishamajig#0054
did you check my comparison thing

[24-Sep-17 09:40 PM] joelovescash#8182
yah

[24-Sep-17 09:41 PM] joelovescash#8182
idk founders edition cards arent so hot on cooling

[24-Sep-17 09:41 PM] joelovescash#8182
haha pun

[24-Sep-17 09:41 PM] joelovescash#8182

[24-Sep-17 09:41 PM] fishamajig#0054

[24-Sep-17 09:41 PM] joelovescash#8182
just stick with the 1060

[24-Sep-17 09:41 PM] joelovescash#8182
thats a good one

[24-Sep-17 09:41 PM] joelovescash#8182
make sure that one fits tho

[24-Sep-17 09:41 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
hey bob. how much do you think your build will be?

[24-Sep-17 09:41 PM] joelovescash#8182
triple fan cards are really long

[24-Sep-17 09:42 PM] fishamajig#0054
probabyl 1500 including keyboard mouse monitor all that shit

[24-Sep-17 09:42 PM] joelovescash#8182
good stuff

[24-Sep-17 09:42 PM] joelovescash#8182
the thing is you can always upgrade little parts

[24-Sep-17 09:42 PM] joelovescash#8182
as you go

[24-Sep-17 09:42 PM] joelovescash#8182
so the same case could last you forever if you wanted

[24-Sep-17 09:42 PM] fishamajig#0054
yeah

[24-Sep-17 09:43 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I'm pretty retarded when it comes to computer parts. which is why the doxseys helped me pick my list. Does my graphics card run 4k?

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LYN9KK6/?tag=pcpapi-20&th=1

[24-Sep-17 09:44 PM] joelovescash#8182
yah depends what games

[24-Sep-17 09:44 PM] joelovescash#8182
do you have a 4k monitor?

[24-Sep-17 09:44 PM] fishamajig#0054
max video card length 13.8 but the one i have is 11.3

[24-Sep-17 09:45 PM] joelovescash#8182
nice

[24-Sep-17 09:45 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
no but I plan on getting one

[24-Sep-17 09:45 PM] joelovescash#8182
what games

[24-Sep-17 09:45 PM] joelovescash#8182
games like isaac will run fine

[24-Sep-17 09:45 PM] fishamajig#0054
i wanna play isaac in 4k

[24-Sep-17 09:45 PM] fishamajig#0054
i wanna play isaac in 6k

[24-Sep-17 09:45 PM] joelovescash#8182
haha

[24-Sep-17 09:45 PM] joelovescash#8182
isaac could run on integrated graphics in 8k

[24-Sep-17 09:46 PM] joelovescash#8182
idk that might be a stretch

[24-Sep-17 09:46 PM] fishamajig#0054
i want windows 10 pro for the slave

[24-Sep-17 09:46 PM] joelovescash#8182
high detail games like doom will need a more powerful card to run at 4k max graphics

[24-Sep-17 09:46 PM] joelovescash#8182
just download it off piratebay or something

[24-Sep-17 09:46 PM] joelovescash#8182
i did that

[24-Sep-17 09:46 PM] joelovescash#8182
worked out fine

[24-Sep-17 09:47 PM] joelovescash#8182
cracked it online somewhere afterwards

[24-Sep-17 09:47 PM] fishamajig#0054
i dont want to ruin my new pc with viruses

[24-Sep-17 09:47 PM] joelovescash#8182
well then buy it

[24-Sep-17 09:47 PM] fishamajig#0054
lol

[24-Sep-17 09:47 PM] fishamajig#0054
is it worth it to have the slave

[24-Sep-17 09:47 PM] joelovescash#8182
if you get a virus just wipe the system

[24-Sep-17 09:47 PM] fishamajig#0054
in your opinion

[24-Sep-17 09:47 PM] joelovescash#8182
slave?

[24-Sep-17 09:47 PM] fishamajig#0054
like mirroring

[24-Sep-17 09:47 PM] fishamajig#0054
with a laptop

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] joelovescash#8182
oh remote desktop...

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] joelovescash#8182
yah

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I didnt want it to seem like a budget build. Does it honestly seem like a budget build?

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] fishamajig#0054
thats the one

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] joelovescash#8182
you can use it on your phone too

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] fishamajig#0054
no nate

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] fishamajig#0054
ive seen budget builds for 400

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] joelovescash#8182
haha i was editing photos on my pc while on the road to school

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] fishamajig#0054

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] joelovescash#8182
budget builds kinda suck

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] joelovescash#8182
nate you have a nice gpu

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] fishamajig#0054
yeah

[24-Sep-17 09:48 PM] joelovescash#8182
that will be able to play some nice games

[24-Sep-17 09:49 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
but chris, is it a budget build?

[24-Sep-17 09:49 PM] joelovescash#8182
idk sure

[24-Sep-17 09:49 PM] joelovescash#8182
since you have no starting parts yes

[24-Sep-17 09:49 PM] fishamajig#0054
i feel like i wanna buy a keyboard in a store so ican feel

[24-Sep-17 09:49 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
what are starting parts?

[24-Sep-17 09:49 PM] joelovescash#8182
most budget builds on youtube start with parts they already had

[24-Sep-17 09:49 PM] joelovescash#8182
so they dont count it in the pirce

[24-Sep-17 09:50 PM] joelovescash#8182
or they find a deal on ebay

[24-Sep-17 09:50 PM] joelovescash#8182
kinda cheating

[24-Sep-17 09:50 PM] joelovescash#8182
your build is good

[24-Sep-17 09:50 PM] joelovescash#8182

[24-Sep-17 09:51 PM] joelovescash#8182
its nice that there so many options

[24-Sep-17 09:51 PM] joelovescash#8182

[24-Sep-17 09:57 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
oh so a benchmark shows how well ur card will run games on max?

[24-Sep-17 09:58 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[24-Sep-17 09:59 PM] joelovescash#8182
lol definitely

[24-Sep-17 09:59 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
whew thank god

[24-Sep-17 09:59 PM] joelovescash#8182
when you get to games like city skylines and other big games it starts taxing the cpu more

[24-Sep-17 10:00 PM] joelovescash#8182
since theres more calculations than just the graphics

[24-Sep-17 10:00 PM] joelovescash#8182
sims should run fine tho

[24-Sep-17 10:00 PM] joelovescash#8182
what year did that even come out in?

[24-Sep-17 10:00 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
i was only joking about the sims

[24-Sep-17 10:00 PM] joelovescash#8182
lol

[24-Sep-17 10:01 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[24-Sep-17 10:01 PM] joelovescash#8182

[24-Sep-17 10:01 PM] joelovescash#8182
not worth it tho

[24-Sep-17 10:11 PM] fishamajig#0054
Fuuuuuck

[24-Sep-17 10:13 PM] fishamajig#0054
Gotta get the dual monitors

[24-Sep-17 10:14 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
so I did some math, your core build besides the monitors, KB, and mouse, is 1400

[24-Sep-17 10:15 PM] fishamajig#0054
I'm not willing to spend 2200

[24-Sep-17 10:15 PM] fishamajig#0054
Yeah

[24-Sep-17 10:15 PM] fishamajig#0054
Fuck I have expensive taste

[24-Sep-17 10:15 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I thought my build was expensive, lol

[24-Sep-17 10:15 PM] fishamajig#0054
Jfc I'm not gonna be able to pull this off

[24-Sep-17 10:15 PM] fishamajig#0054
I wanted to spend no more than 1000

[24-Sep-17 10:16 PM] fishamajig#0054
And now I'm gonna have to spend double

[24-Sep-17 10:17 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
damn, that sucks man. PC part shopping is a nail biter when it comes to the prices of what you truly want

[24-Sep-17 10:17 PM] fishamajig#0054
Yeah fuck

[24-Sep-17 10:17 PM] fishamajig#0054
I need to get a job first

[24-Sep-17 10:18 PM] fishamajig#0054
I'm only okay with spending that kind of money if I have steady income

[24-Sep-17 10:23 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
yeah, i just gave my 2 weeks notice

[24-Sep-17 10:24 PM] fishamajig#0054
Really why?

[24-Sep-17 10:25 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Cuz the working conditions at the Dollar Tree were shitty

[24-Sep-17 10:25 PM] fishamajig#0054
Hahahahaha

[24-Sep-17 10:26 PM] fishamajig#0054
Unionize

[24-Sep-17 10:26 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I gave my application to dunkin donuts in sterling and the girl I handed it to said i'll probably get a call because the boss is hiring a lot of people

[24-Sep-17 10:26 PM] fishamajig#0054
Oh wow

[24-Sep-17 10:26 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
yeah i hope it works out

[24-Sep-17 10:26 PM] fishamajig#0054
You gonna make more money there?

[24-Sep-17 10:27 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
idk probably not

[24-Sep-17 10:27 PM] fishamajig#0054
Damn

[24-Sep-17 10:27 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
but itll be a way easier job tho

[24-Sep-17 10:27 PM] fishamajig#0054
I don't know man people are assholes

[24-Sep-17 10:27 PM] fishamajig#0054
I'd hate a job where I have to work with people like that

[24-Sep-17 10:28 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
the people I worked at the dollar tree with were either retarded or assholes. only one of them was nice

[24-Sep-17 10:28 PM] fishamajig#0054
I mean dealing with the customers

[24-Sep-17 10:29 PM] fishamajig#0054
If you put cream instead of half and half in some dudes coffee he might shoot up his school

[24-Sep-17 10:29 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
as long as he doesnt shoot up the dunkins im in

[24-Sep-17 10:30 PM] fishamajig#0054
You might get robbed

[24-Sep-17 10:30 PM] fishamajig#0054
Or raped

[24-Sep-17 10:30 PM] fishamajig#0054
But think of the perks

[24-Sep-17 10:30 PM] fishamajig#0054
You can fuck all the bagels your heart desires

[24-Sep-17 10:31 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I mean its sterling, the quietest place is MA

Hahaha

[24-Sep-17 10:32 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
its ok tho, because they had it coming

[24-Sep-17 10:33 PM] fishamajig#0054
I mean who doesn't have it coming now adays

[24-Sep-17 10:33 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

only gonna get one monitor tho, not sure which one

[25-Sep-17 02:56 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Why did you pick that gpu?

[25-Sep-17 02:57 PM] fishamajig#0054
Had good reviews, and seems like the best I can get at that tier without going 1070 or 1080

[25-Sep-17 02:58 PM] fishamajig#0054
But I'm up for suggestions

[25-Sep-17 02:58 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
I think it's expensive for a 1060

[25-Sep-17 02:58 PM] fishamajig#0054
They're all kinda pricey

[25-Sep-17 02:59 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Ya but that is like 60 bucks more than others that have the same specs

[25-Sep-17 03:00 PM] fishamajig#0054
At that price should i just go 1070?

[25-Sep-17 03:00 PM] fishamajig#0054
Or is a cheap 1060 all i need

[25-Sep-17 03:00 PM] fishamajig#0054
Chris posted a 1060 that's cheaper

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Bancho, the barbaric?

[17-Dec-17 12:26 AM] fishamajig#0054
On a dreary afternoon, the sound of thunder could be heard in the distance. It was coming from Bancho land, ruled by none other than Bancho Bot. The townsfolk were displeased with Bancho's reign, but had no power to oppose him. Each day Bancho would descend from his castle and enter the town.

okay time for a new story

[23-Dec-17 08:06 PM] Miles#3711
once upon a time

[23-Dec-17 08:07 PM] Miles#3711
there was a land filled with squares

[23-Dec-17 08:07 PM] Miles#3711
and all these squares lived very happy, comfortable lives together

[23-Dec-17 08:07 PM] Miles#3711
until one day

[23-Dec-17 08:08 PM] Miles#3711
when a family of circles moved into their neighborhood

[23-Dec-17 08:08 PM] Miles#3711
as soon as they did, the squares began to ostracize the family of circles

[23-Dec-17 08:09 PM] Miles#3711
soon after, the circles were taken to a secret place in the middle of the woods

[23-Dec-17 08:10 PM] Miles#3711
the squares began to burn the circles at various stakes made for them

[23-Dec-17 08:10 PM] Miles#3711
"why are you doing this?", shouted the circles in agony

[23-Dec-17 08:10 PM] Miles#3711
"because this is a metaphor for racism" said the squares, as the circles perished

[23-Dec-17 08:11 PM] Miles#3711
theee endo

[23-Dec-17 08:11 PM] fishamajig#0054
And they all lived happily ever after

[23-Dec-17 08:13 PM] Miles#3711
"jesus told me to do it, he told me circles are whores"

[23-Dec-17 08:13 PM] fishamajig#0054
And they were

[23-Dec-17 08:26 PM] Miles#3711

"Whatever! Now u can go anh have sex with Vampire!" I shouted. I stormed into my room and closed my black door with my blood-red key. It had a picture of Marylin Manson on it. He looked so sexy in a way that reminded me of Draco and Vampire. I started to cry and weep. I took a razor and started to slit my wrists. I drank the blood all depressed. Then I looked at my black GC watch and noticed it was time to go to Biology class.

I put on a short ripped black gothic dress that said Anarchy on the front in blood red letters and was all ripped and a spiky belt. Under that I put on ripped black fishnets and boots that said Joel all over them with blood red letters. I put my ebony black hair out. Anyway I went downstairs feeling all sad and depressed as usual. I did sum advanced Biology work. I was turning a bloody pentagram into a black guitar. Suddenly the guitar turned to Draco!

"Enoby I love you!" he shouted sadly. "I dnot care what those fucker preps and posers fink. Ur da most beautiful girl in the world. Before I met you I used to want to commit suicide all the time. Now I just wanna fucking be with you. I fucking love you!." Then‚Ä¶. he started to sing "Da Chronicles of Life and Death" (we considered it our song now cuz we fell in love when Joel was singing it) right in front of the entire class! His singing voice was so amazing and gothic and sexxy like a cross between Gerard, Joel, Chester, Pierre and Marilyn Manson (AN: don't u fink dos guyz r so hot. if u dnot no who dey r get da fuk out od hr!) .

"OMFG." I said after he was finished. Some fucking preps stared at us but I just stuck up my middle fingers (that were covered in black nail polish and were entwined with Draco's now) at them. "I love you!" I said and then we started to kiss just like Hilary Duff (i fukin h8 dat bitch) and CMM in a Cinderella Story. Then we went away holding hands. Loopin shouted at us but he stopped cuz everyone was clapping by how sexy we looked 2gether.

[04-Jan-18 10:45 PM] Miles#3711
Then I saw a poster saying that MCR would have a concert in Hogsmede right then. We looked at each other all shocked and then we went 2gether.

Since the 3 acoustic strings on it are extra lights, it shouldn‚Äôt do any damage to the guitar. With the remaining 3 strings being classical, the combination sounds great

[08-Jan-18 05:07 PM] Miles#3711
"you clone yourself by beleeeving"

[08-Jan-18 05:08 PM] Miles#3711
"i belebe"

[08-Jan-18 05:09 PM] Miles#3711
as soon as he said those words he departed back into the freezing month of september

[08-Jan-18 05:12 PM] Miles#3711
"ummm maaaamaaa"

[08-Jan-18 05:12 PM] Miles#3711
he shouted

[08-Jan-18 05:12 PM] Miles#3711
he looked around confused

[08-Jan-18 05:13 PM] Miles#3711
"why did I say such a thing", he pondered as a thought bubble with those exact wordsappeared above him

[08-Jan-18 05:13 PM] Miles#3711
as he began to flect

[08-Jan-18 05:13 PM] Miles#3711
he wiped the sweat off his floppy brow

[08-Jan-18 05:26 PM] Miles#3711

[08-Jan-18 05:27 PM] Miles#3711

[23-Mar-18 12:20 AM] TitaniumOx#9494

[23-Mar-18 12:20 AM] TitaniumOx#9494

An ox spends 98% of its life alone, roaming from land to land. Not in search of trouble, but trouble always finding it.

[23-Mar-18 12:28 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
An ox only sleeps when it draws its last breath

[23-Mar-18 12:28 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
I must no longer sleep

[23-Mar-18 12:29 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
Instead I will drive to the same two 24 hour mcdonalds back to back until the sun awakens once again

[29-Mar-18 08:01 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Like I was watching a video of this bull in a ring having darts thrown at it, then it breaks out and stabs some chick in the guts, and throws her like a ragdoll

[29-Mar-18 08:03 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Why do we keep animals in zoos if they can easily fuck us up and break out

[29-Mar-18 09:28 PM] fishamajig#0054
I think the animals have every right to be pissed. I'd be pissed if I was caged up and put on display. The ones that get out should be rewarded and allowed to kill as many as they please. It's only fair

last week, I left a note for my boss stating that I need saturdays off, meaning I would work tuesdays and sundays until summer started. then once its Summer, I can go back to working my regular 4 days a week.  She didn't say anything to me for that whole week, not even a text in response.  I went into work today and I check the new schedule, my name wasnt on it.  I was expected to work 12-6 today. I asked the 2 people I was supposed to work with if they cared if i left, they both said no. so I bounced.

[01-Apr-18 02:45 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

How much does it go for online?

[07-Apr-18 02:26 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I saw some on ebay going for 100-125

[07-Apr-18 02:26 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

Hopefully

[08-Apr-18 11:36 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
so far, all the changes they have made in far cry 5 have all been for the better

[08-Apr-18 11:36 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
the hunting in the game is miles better than that of FC3 and FC4

[08-Apr-18 11:42 AM] fishamajig#0054
That‚Äôs cool. Glad you like it

[08-Apr-18 03:30 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Every ending to far cry 5 sucks.

[08-Apr-18 03:31 PM] fishamajig#0054
You already beat the genre?

[08-Apr-18 03:31 PM] fishamajig#0054
Game*

[08-Apr-18 03:31 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
No matter what you do, none of your actions matter. Im genuinely surprised ubisoft fucked up the endings that bad

[08-Apr-18 03:31 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
No but i watched them all

[08-Apr-18 03:32 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Its ok if a game has a sad ending. But there has to be a point to your actions throughout the game

[08-Apr-18 03:32 PM] fishamajig#0054
Oh. Classic ubisoft

Honestly, you gotta respect a man with no filter at all

[09-Apr-18 07:11 PM] fishamajig#0054
He's gonna get his ass beat one of these days

[09-Apr-18 07:14 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
For the most part, I think other people he encounters know he has mental problems

[09-Apr-18 07:15 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Like even by looking at him you can kinda tell

[09-Apr-18 07:24 PM] fishamajig#0054
Haha true he's certainly a special character

[09-Apr-18 07:26 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Whats sucks the most is that that video was from last year. He has been on the run from the law for a couple months

[09-Apr-18 07:26 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Theres a warrant out for his arrest because he missed a court hearing or something

[09-Apr-18 07:27 PM] fishamajig#0054
Hahaha that's crazy. Can't make that shit up

[09-Apr-18 07:30 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I genuinely feel bad for him tho

[09-Apr-18 07:31 PM] fishamajig#0054
The gummint just wants everyone to suffer

[09-Apr-18 07:31 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[09-Apr-18 07:32 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Terry isn‚Äôt a violent man. He should not go to the slammer

[09-Apr-18 07:32 PM] fishamajig#0054
I think we should take an entire state, maybe Montana, and force everyone out. Then we build a giant fence around the border. Then we bring all prisoners into said state, and let them roam free.

[09-Apr-18 07:33 PM] fishamajig#0054
No rules, no regulations, just border control.

[09-Apr-18 07:34 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
That will be our new world order

[09-Apr-18 08:40 PM] fishamajig#0054
We could televise it and make money off of it. Like a hunger games style thing

[09-Apr-18 09:47 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Well the problem with that is are we putting ALL criminals in Montana to fight in an arena, or just ones who have committed horrible acts

[09-Apr-18 09:47 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Like im not talking about murder

[09-Apr-18 09:47 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Im talking about murdering children and puppies and then raping the carcasses

[09-Apr-18 09:48 PM] fishamajig#0054
It would be everything from tax evasion yo unpaid parking tickets to child sex trafficking and terrorist acts

[09-Apr-18 09:56 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Quite the mishmash

Weezer is p.good too

[09-Apr-18 10:19 PM] fishamajig#0054
I like them because they're still good. Like a lot of bands from the 90s tried to adapt to 2000s and got shitty. Green day and weezer didn't. They still sound just as good

[09-Apr-18 10:19 PM] fishamajig#0054

R Lee Ermey, the fucking legend himself, passed away today at age 74

[15-Apr-18 08:27 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Hearing that actually made me sad man

[15-Apr-18 09:00 PM] fishamajig#0054
Fill me in

[16-Apr-18 10:39 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
Ermey was the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket

[16-Apr-18 10:39 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
He also did a lot of voice acting in tv shows and video games

[16-Apr-18 10:40 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
He was a good guy. 95% of celebrities deaths dont really make me feel sad, but Ermey and George Michaels actually hit me in the feels

Sam Hyde is the hidden genius of our generation

[24-Apr-18 05:19 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
We are not living in ‚Äúreal life‚Äù anymore. The entire Earth entered a different dimension right after 1/1/07.

[24-Apr-18 05:27 PM] fishamajig#0054
Probably because the earth is flat

[24-Apr-18 05:28 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
^^^^^

[24-Apr-18 05:28 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
amen

[24-Apr-18 05:29 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
By 2060, every country in Europe and the state of California will end with "-istan".

[24-Apr-18 05:30 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
The US will engage in a brief civil war, in which Californistan will be left uninhabitable.

[24-Apr-18 05:32 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Oregon and Nevada will be left irradiated by mass nuclear fallout for generations.

[24-Apr-18 05:40 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
The president will still be Donald Trump, however, he will be 70% cyborg.

[24-Apr-18 05:42 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Russia has gained complete control over all of China. China is no more, it is now Russia.

[24-Apr-18 05:44 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
The Middle East has become two countries, Istanistan and Israel.

[24-Apr-18 05:44 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Israel is on the brink of extinction, however. The whole world has become extremely tired of the jews.

[24-Apr-18 05:45 PM] fishamajig#0054
Wow. ALl of this is actually really plausible

[24-Apr-18 05:45 PM] fishamajig#0054
All

[24-Apr-18 05:46 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
It's not plausible Bobby, it is destiny.

[24-Apr-18 05:46 PM] fishamajig#0054
It's practically already written into the history textbooks

[24-Apr-18 05:48 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Africa has now become nearly lifeless, the black race is now seen as a rare species.

[24-Apr-18 05:48 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
The only humans that remain are either white, brown, or yellow.

[24-Apr-18 05:50 PM] fishamajig#0054
Spics will have completely taken over America and the Americans will have pushed Canadians onto reservations and taken their land

[24-Apr-18 05:50 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Feral ghouls and mutated humanoids are all that remain in the quarantine zones that used to be known as Nevada and Oregon.

[24-Apr-18 05:52 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Spics have completely invaded both the Americas. Canada is now known as "America 2". The only Canadians that escaped execution by fire are living on reservations set up in Cuba and Alaska.

[24-Apr-18 05:53 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Movies and music have been banned entirely, creation of either form of media is punishable by death.

[24-Apr-18 05:54 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Feminism and the Democratic party are now seen as old jokes of the past.

[24-Apr-18 05:55 PM] fishamajig#0054
Nate you should write a dystopian novel

[24-Apr-18 05:55 PM] fishamajig#0054
I would buy that shit so fast

[24-Apr-18 05:55 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I honestly really want to

[24-Apr-18 05:55 PM] fishamajig#0054
At the very least you could write a fan fiction type story

[24-Apr-18 05:56 PM] fishamajig#0054
But you have to include a goth wizard

[24-Apr-18 05:57 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
The goth wizard will be "Mac Venom Solidus", a bounty hunter that plans on taking back the world.

[24-Apr-18 05:59 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
The new dictator of Russia is a hologram of Lenin, who is now a transsexual fox-kin.

In an extreme turn of events, North Korea actually dropped nuclear warheads on Australia instead of America. Australia is now nothing more than a sinking pile of radiation, a place gross people used to call ‚Äúhome‚Äù. Nobody cared.

[25-Apr-18 04:20 PM] Will Doxsey#0296

Word up
T. Yoshisaur Munchakoopas is my name
And Imma tell you how I beat the IRS at their own game
I lied on my tax forms cuz I just don't give a fuck
Now I'm practically swimming around in big bucks

I got 12 million dollars in my attic undeclared
And I got another million more right under my stairs
I do my business deals under cover of the night
So I can hide the cash away from Uncle Sam without a fight

I take advantage of every loophole, even ones that don't apply
It's been 20 years, still haven't been caught in a lie
I claimed Baby Mario as a dependent though he ain't my kid
And made up charity work I never even did
I must have cheated on my tax forms at least a hundred times
So many clever tricks I can't fit them all into rhymes
Yoshi is my name, money laundering is my game
And committing tax fraud is worth every single dime

I'm a tax dodging badass, I don't play by the rules
I make the government look like a bunch of damn fools
I keep 99 cents of every dollar that I make
Nothing makes me cum faster than a good ol' tax break
I hate paying taxes if there's anything I hate
I supported Ron Paul back in 2008
You might think it's unfair that I don't have to pay
But it's okay because taxation is theft anyway

Word to your mother

Peace out yo

my internet was wack all night anyway rip

[16-May-18 12:57 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
I figured out the yanny or laurel thing. It‚Äôs 2 separate voices. The higher pitched one says yanny, but the lower pitched one says laurel a millisecond after the ya in yanny is pronounced.

[16-May-18 01:18 AM] fishamajig#0054
And what is this from?

[16-May-18 01:20 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
its some retarded internet thing, similar to the whole "blue and black or white and gold" dress thing back in 2014. the yanny or laurel thing is a sample of audio

[16-May-18 01:26 AM] fishamajig#0054

I heard Yanny at first but now I can only hear laurel

[16-May-18 01:30 AM] TitaniumOx#9494

[16-May-18 01:30 AM] fishamajig#0054

Yo Dylan is your osu laggy as fuck after the windows update?

[20-May-18 09:32 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
He says yes

[20-May-18 09:36 PM] fishamajig#0054
Is it when he uses the pen?

[20-May-18 09:36 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Yep

[20-May-18 09:36 PM] fishamajig#0054
Have him try with the mouse

[20-May-18 09:37 PM] fishamajig#0054
I'm trying  to get some evidence here

[20-May-18 09:37 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Ok

[20-May-18 09:37 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
When we get hime

[20-May-18 09:38 PM] fishamajig#0054
Okay

[20-May-18 09:38 PM] fishamajig#0054
I think it's the pen tablet software that's lagging, not osu itself

[20-May-18 09:38 PM] fishamajig#0054
Which is fucking annoying because I don't wanna play with mouse

[20-May-18 09:38 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Lol

[20-May-18 09:38 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Who does

[20-May-18 09:38 PM] fishamajig#0054

[20-May-18 09:39 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Truw

[20-May-18 09:39 PM] fishamajig#0054
When I try pen my lag spikes to 11-24 ms of lag whereas the mouse remains steady at 8.4ms where it always has been

[20-May-18 09:45 PM] joelovescash#8182

go to the huion/other dropdown and follow those instructions

[20-May-18 10:54 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Unrelated, but...If you lived in a run down town and a group of militants set up camp in said town and offered to give you protection in return for paying taxes, would you be ok with it?

[20-May-18 10:56 PM] joelovescash#8182
maybe

[20-May-18 10:56 PM] joelovescash#8182
depends how much

[20-May-18 10:57 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
A decent amount. In this town nobody really has a job so you don‚Äôt make much money.

[20-May-18 10:57 PM] joelovescash#8182
is money in place of paying taxes?

[20-May-18 10:58 PM] joelovescash#8182
like to the gov

[20-May-18 10:58 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Not necessarily to a gov. Just to this military organization

[20-May-18 10:58 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Cuz there isn‚Äôt really any stable gov

[20-May-18 10:58 PM] fishamajig#0054
who are they protecting us from

[20-May-18 10:59 PM] joelovescash#8182
so the only tax is to the militants?

[20-May-18 10:59 PM] joelovescash#8182
there is no federal government to pay taxes to?

[20-May-18 10:59 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Raiders and gang members

[20-May-18 10:59 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
And yeah, the money goes to this military. There isnt and fed gov

[20-May-18 11:00 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Isnt any*

[20-May-18 11:00 PM] joelovescash#8182
well of course then

[20-May-18 11:00 PM] joelovescash#8182
thats basically what we do anyways

[20-May-18 11:00 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
True

[20-May-18 11:00 PM] joelovescash#8182
on a less primitive scale

[20-May-18 11:00 PM] joelovescash#8182
they can provide a service you can't

[20-May-18 11:01 PM] joelovescash#8182
you might be able to protect yourself from a few people but theres power in numbers

[20-May-18 11:01 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Well, the problem is that you dont have a stable flow of income. Once you cant pay taxes, you gotta leave or else get imprisoned or shot

[20-May-18 11:02 PM] joelovescash#8182
tricky

[20-May-18 11:02 PM] joelovescash#8182
id say worth it while it lasts

[20-May-18 11:05 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Yeah. Id go with it, but once i run out of money Id try to form a takeover. I might end up getting shot either way so why not take a risk

[20-May-18 11:19 PM] fishamajig#0054

[21-May-18 01:44 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
After the poison-induced orgy, they all gather ‚Äòround to enjoy one last fireworks show before boarding the mothership.

Guys, I‚Äôm crazy about post-modernist aesthetic contextual reframing

[04-Jun-18 02:43 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
apparently im lawful neutral

[04-Jun-18 02:43 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Lawful Neutral- A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs him. Order and organization are paramount to him. He may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or he may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government. Lawful neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot. However, lawful neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it seeks to eliminate all freedom, choice, and diversity in society.

[04-Jun-18 02:44 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
but im not a fan of the government, nor do I want to eliminate freedom

[04-Jun-18 02:45 PM] fishamajig#0054
That's similar to me I guess

[04-Jun-18 02:46 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Does anyone wanna hangout tonight, Im bored as hell

Bill Mahr just said that he wants America to fall into a new Great Depression because that will somehow remove Trump from the presidency. He says that if the economy tanks then the president will have to resign or become replaced. Does this fat-nosed, fag-haired, human-nematode retard not know about the economic disaster that took place during Obama‚Äôs FIRST YEAR in office?

Bobby is the Elvis-kind of guy. He gets all the chicks because he can both play guitar and sing.

[12-Jun-18 09:30 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Nate is the unstable Kurt Cobain-type. His reckless behavior and mass drug use both on and off stage will likely lead to a heroin-induced shotgun suicide

[12-Jun-18 09:32 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Dylan is quite possibly the band‚Äôs most talented player. However his extreme drug and alcohol addiction may lead him to a young death. However it is likely he will survive his 11th overdose and then go into rehab and discover Christ.

[12-Jun-18 09:33 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Will is the straight edge of the group. He stayed determined to not only contribute to the band, but to also improve his playing abilities everday. He will go on to become an outstanding solo artist and will be the only member of the band left normal.

[12-Jun-18 09:34 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Who has the drug induced coma after the biggest album of our career, inspiring our darker later albums?

[12-Jun-18 09:34 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Probably both Dylan and I simultaneously.

[12-Jun-18 09:35 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
We both see who can shootup the most heroin in one night and both end up in a coma for 73 hours.

[12-Jun-18 09:35 PM] Will Doxsey#0296

you will be last photographed lying upon a stack of wood, holding a single rose in one hand and a copy of our first album in the other. The bloody chunk of swiss cheese that is the remains of your head will be covered up by a latex Obama mask.

Nothing really, just the vocals are pretty not good

[16-Jun-18 01:16 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
The first song on the album should be "a man threw a heavy stick, and knock me brain out"

[16-Jun-18 01:18 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
The next one" mike microwaved an coke and it knock me brain out"

[16-Jun-18 01:19 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Next "me pa drop a lamppost and it knock me brain out"

[16-Jun-18 01:20 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Last" mama hit me with bottle, and it knocked her brain out"

[17-Jun-18 01:26 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[17-Jun-18 01:29 PM] fishamajig#0054

This guy has a name that arguably lessens the meaning of 9/11 by his standards of this promoting antisemitism XD

Should all be burned at the stake

[19-Jun-18 04:58 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
agreed, especially nowadays. like 75% of college girls are vile skanks

[19-Jun-18 04:59 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
in an older era, these females would be called "loose women" AKA whores, but nowadays they are just called college girls

[19-Jun-18 05:01 PM] fishamajig#0054
It's like they think it's socially acceptable to fuck as many guys as they can in college but in reality it makes them less desirable

[19-Jun-18 05:02 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
100% man.

[19-Jun-18 05:03 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
why would a guy want to form a relationship with a girl that is easy? nothing is special about these girls.

[19-Jun-18 05:04 PM] fishamajig#0054
They're not good at conversation. They don't have personalities. They have nothing to offer but their stretched out cooters

[19-Jun-18 05:05 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
^^^^^^^^^^^^

[19-Jun-18 05:06 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
they are just useless at everything besides looking good and being loud, entitled irritants

[19-Jun-18 05:08 PM] fishamajig#0054
Real women are hard to come by. Ones that are attractive but not anorexic and stuck up. Ones that can keep their legs closed. Ones that can make decisions for themselves. Ones that are intelligent and don't rely on looks to get what they want

i can relate to this to a fucking T

[19-Jun-18 05:13 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
i used to work with girls at DD that were either whores or closet whores with stupid fuckin tattoos

[19-Jun-18 05:13 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
like who the fuck gets a tattoo of the outline of a wave on their 18th birthday

[19-Jun-18 05:16 PM] fishamajig#0054
They're gonna look back at that in 20 years and think "what was I thinking"

[19-Jun-18 05:16 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
if they even live that long

[19-Jun-18 05:16 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
we have an hpv epidemic on the rise

[19-Jun-18 05:17 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
because these skanks dont know the consequences of not keeping their legs shut

[19-Jun-18 05:20 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
i dont hate women, i just hate 49 out of every 50 of them (excluding family, obviously)

[19-Jun-18 05:25 PM] fishamajig#0054
Actually that hpv point is super relevant. It's a big problem right now

[19-Jun-18 05:25 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
yeah, everything I just said I really meant

[19-Jun-18 05:25 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
maybe not 49/50 but still

[19-Jun-18 05:28 PM] fishamajig#0054
Hahaha

[19-Jun-18 05:28 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
what I mean is that I dont hate 49 out of every 50 women

[19-Jun-18 05:28 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
but I still have a lot of hate in my heart

[19-Jun-18 05:52 PM] fishamajig#0054
It's good to have hate in your heart

[19-Jun-18 05:53 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Its make one stronger

I feel horrible for the family, but a condition like this should be prevented at any cost.

[24-Jun-18 01:42 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
those two aren't even living, they are borderline existing.

[24-Jun-18 01:55 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
well, I guess there is a light at the end of the tunnel. If they ever get tired of raising them just put them in a pool and come back in 15 minutes.

Is death note a good anime to read the Manga for and then watch

[24-Jun-18 10:24 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
Manga and anime are basically the same

[24-Jun-18 10:24 AM] fishamajig#0054
So do one or the other

[24-Jun-18 10:24 AM] Will Doxsey#0296

I mean it's decent

[24-Jun-18 10:28 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
But they throw in a lot of shit that is just simply bad storytelling

[24-Jun-18 10:29 AM] Will Doxsey#0296

Democratic politicians do not give a shit about illegal immigrants families being separated. They only reason they want these illegal immigrants to stay in America is so they can vote for Democrats.

[25-Jun-18 06:13 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
It‚Äôs true

[25-Jun-18 06:13 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
And the family superstition thing was blown so far out of proportion

[25-Jun-18 06:13 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
There were only around 2500

[25-Jun-18 06:15 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Out of the hundreds of thousands of families arrested at the boarder

[25-Jun-18 08:04 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
More like be forced to vote

[25-Jun-18 08:06 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
So Dylan, only 2500 of the families were actually separated?

[25-Jun-18 08:07 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Ya

[25-Jun-18 08:07 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
At least that‚Äôs what I heard on the news

[25-Jun-18 08:07 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
They said 500+ were reunited and under 2000 were still seperated

[25-Jun-18 08:07 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Fucking political machines all over again

[25-Jun-18 08:08 PM] Will Doxsey#0296

[25-Jun-18 08:08 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Ik

[25-Jun-18 08:08 PM] Will Doxsey#0296

I like the idea that when you read this and see my pic, you may be thinking your dad is saying it

[25-Jun-18 08:10 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Exactly, Dad. And the families that are still separated is due to the fact that either the father or mother committed a felony, like drunk driving, robbery, or assault.

[25-Jun-18 08:10 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
I know

Simple solution: If we get rid of the welfare system in America, then 90% of these illegal immigrants will leave and not come back.

[26-Jun-18 02:38 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I dont mind hispanic people or any immigrants really. I just dont want people breaking simple laws. It costs like $200 for a visa, thats nothing.

Honestly. Idk if the blues driver would go good with bass. It sounds great on guitar but it really isnt fully utilized on bass.

[28-Jun-18 06:46 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
And plus, i know you (will) and dylan will want the blues driver on your pedalboards for the band

What does the monster sound like on bass?

[28-Jun-18 06:48 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Its a good overdrive, but the low end of a bass just takes over the gain that the BD is known for.

[28-Jun-18 06:57 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Get a dildo with suction cup, and stick it in the spot it would be

[28-Jun-18 06:59 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I would do that, but it wont fit in the case

[28-Jun-18 06:59 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Damn

[28-Jun-18 07:01 PM] Will Doxsey#0296

When‚Äôs the next time everyone is around to do stuff

[28-Jun-18 07:01 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Originally I was looking for an overdrive, however a second distortion would be good too. It would come after an octave pedal and before a phaser and chorus.

[28-Jun-18 07:01 PM] Cheeky Breeky#6216
Like next weekend or something?

[28-Jun-18 07:02 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
@chris yeah

[28-Jun-18 07:03 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
I can probably do next weekend

[28-Jun-18 07:03 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Depends on the time next weekend

[28-Jun-18 07:04 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
@TitaniumOx bass synth or slow gear

[28-Jun-18 07:04 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I was gonna do slow gear, but its their rarest pedal lol

[28-Jun-18 07:05 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I was think about doing a second distorion, but idk

[28-Jun-18 07:05 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I was thinking about bass synth but idk how we would utalize it

[28-Jun-18 07:06 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Dam slow gear sounds rad

[28-Jun-18 07:06 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
We could find a way

[28-Jun-18 07:06 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I know, its siiiick

[28-Jun-18 07:06 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
I bet a bass solo would sound rad with synth coming on and off

[28-Jun-18 07:07 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Shit son, you right

[28-Jun-18 07:07 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
We could definitely use that

[28-Jun-18 07:07 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Nategar was being stoopid worm

[28-Jun-18 07:07 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Idk probe not worth if really expensive

[28-Jun-18 07:08 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Its like 150

[28-Jun-18 07:08 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
The slow gear is 300 on the low end

[28-Jun-18 07:08 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Ooh

[28-Jun-18 07:08 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Steep

[28-Jun-18 07:08 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Fuck

[28-Jun-18 07:09 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Yeah

[28-Jun-18 07:09 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Once we r huge and make tons of money we‚Äôll get it

[28-Jun-18 07:09 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
For sure dawg

[28-Jun-18 07:09 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I will

[28-Jun-18 07:09 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Idk tho

[28-Jun-18 07:10 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
150 is still pretty steep

[28-Jun-18 07:10 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Yeah

[28-Jun-18 07:10 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
The tera echo was 150, but that one was a more limited run cuz it was there 100th pedal

[28-Jun-18 07:12 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Ya that ones rad too

[28-Jun-18 07:12 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Yeah, I was thinking about having a second distortion, each one having different tones

[28-Jun-18 07:13 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
That‚Äôs a good idea too

[28-Jun-18 07:13 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Thanks dude

[28-Jun-18 07:14 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
The mega distortion is HIGH gain. So the other distortion will be muddier I suppose

[28-Jun-18 07:15 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Ya that makes a lot of sense

[28-Jun-18 07:16 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Thanks site

Sir

[28-Jun-18 08:13 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I think I‚Äôll get the boss xtortion

[28-Jun-18 08:14 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
What‚Äôs that one like?

[28-Jun-18 08:21 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
It gives your bass distortion, but also adds some nuts to the sound

Sounds really good

[28-Jun-18 08:26 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I like it too

[28-Jun-18 08:27 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
So the XT-2 will be more nutty and have more low end, while the MD-2 will have more gain and mid-high end

[28-Jun-18 08:27 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

[29-Jun-18 07:17 PM] joelovescash#8182
so im in russia

[29-Jun-18 07:17 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Woah

[29-Jun-18 07:17 PM] joelovescash#8182
idk why maybe world cup or something

[29-Jun-18 07:18 PM] joelovescash#8182
and i see this sign

[29-Jun-18 07:18 PM] joelovescash#8182
and it says "face wash, genital wash, and rimjob for $50"

[29-Jun-18 07:18 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Lol

[29-Jun-18 07:18 PM] joelovescash#8182
and im like ok lets check this place out

[29-Jun-18 07:18 PM] joelovescash#8182
so i walk in and theres a big line

[29-Jun-18 07:18 PM] joelovescash#8182
all men

[29-Jun-18 07:18 PM] joelovescash#8182
but like tons of ages

[29-Jun-18 07:19 PM] joelovescash#8182
theres fucking kids there

[29-Jun-18 07:19 PM] joelovescash#8182
its like in a big bathroom looking room

[29-Jun-18 07:19 PM] joelovescash#8182
and theres a couple sinks and people are washing their faces in it

[29-Jun-18 07:20 PM] joelovescash#8182
across from it is like a hybrid between a urinal and a bidet

[29-Jun-18 07:20 PM] joelovescash#8182
i assume it was the genital washing

[29-Jun-18 07:20 PM] joelovescash#8182
idk i was intrigued so i skipped the two washing stations and kept walking along

[29-Jun-18 07:20 PM] joelovescash#8182
then it turned into locker rooms

[29-Jun-18 07:21 PM] joelovescash#8182
but it was a single passage that just kept taking right angle turns

[29-Jun-18 07:21 PM] joelovescash#8182
with lockers along the walls

[29-Jun-18 07:21 PM] joelovescash#8182
like think gym locker room

[29-Jun-18 07:21 PM] joelovescash#8182
anyways its pretty long and I walk for like a full minute or two

[29-Jun-18 07:22 PM] joelovescash#8182
I pop out the other side and its like a school hallway

[29-Jun-18 07:22 PM] joelovescash#8182
all the lights are off, but its daytime so you can still see

[29-Jun-18 07:23 PM] joelovescash#8182
all the windows are like that cloudy glass so you cant see outside and the lighting in the hallways insnt great

[29-Jun-18 07:23 PM] joelovescash#8182
I walk down the hallways a little bit

[29-Jun-18 07:23 PM] joelovescash#8182
then i come to these thick double doors

[29-Jun-18 07:24 PM] joelovescash#8182
they were a cross between solid school doors and those swinging black ones you see at restaurants

[29-Jun-18 07:24 PM] joelovescash#8182
I looked through the window and its another hallway with doors lining it and benches too

[29-Jun-18 07:25 PM] joelovescash#8182
theres a bunch of fat dudes sitting on them wearing bathrobes

[29-Jun-18 07:25 PM] joelovescash#8182
but the bathrobes are super thick, like thing russian military coat style

[29-Jun-18 07:25 PM] joelovescash#8182
I guess they were all waiting for their rimjobs

[29-Jun-18 07:26 PM] joelovescash#8182
since you have to wash your face and genitals by yourself, it was basically just a rimjob for 50 bucks I thought to myself

[29-Jun-18 07:26 PM] joelovescash#8182
which is a pretty solid deal

[29-Jun-18 07:27 PM] joelovescash#8182
also that whole hallway behind the door was only lit by those big red caged emergency lights

[29-Jun-18 07:27 PM] joelovescash#8182
so it looked mad sketchy

[29-Jun-18 07:27 PM] joelovescash#8182
I woke up at that point

[29-Jun-18 07:27 PM] joelovescash#8182
I think i decided it looked a bit too sketch just for the rimjob

[29-Jun-18 07:28 PM] joelovescash#8182
i saw one woman take one of the guys into one of the rooms

[29-Jun-18 07:28 PM] joelovescash#8182
but that was it, couldve been dudes doing the rimming in the other rooms for all i know

[29-Jun-18 07:28 PM] joelovescash#8182
welp thats it

[29-Jun-18 07:28 PM] joelovescash#8182
it was a weird dream but i remember all the details and shit

[29-Jun-18 07:28 PM] joelovescash#8182
funky af

[29-Jun-18 07:29 PM] joelovescash#8182
i wish i could've dreamed some great greentext punchline

I agree.

[05-Jul-18 07:29 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
The inside needed a little cleaning. Put wd40 on a magic eraser and wiped the inside and outside a bit. I think it came out nice.

Cuz it smelled like fancy cigars

[05-Jul-18 07:37 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[05-Jul-18 07:37 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

[05-Jul-18 07:38 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

[05-Jul-18 07:50 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

I‚Äôd try and see if I could figure out some of the internals before I buy tho

[05-Jul-18 07:51 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

[05-Jul-18 07:52 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[05-Jul-18 07:53 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
next time I go, I think i'll bring a cable and test to see how the current knobs and adjustments sound.

[05-Jul-18 07:53 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Ya that‚Äôs a good idea

[05-Jul-18 07:54 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
How big is the neck?

[05-Jul-18 07:55 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
the neck is a standard c shape, feels good tho. i might keep the electronics and just change the pickups, honestly.

The best

[12-Jul-18 05:52 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Its the most balanced out state. Good environment, fair laws, affordable cost of living

Is it incest if you have sex with your third cousin but she doesnt consent?

[12-Jul-18 07:53 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
No then it neutralizes out

[12-Jul-18 07:53 PM] Will Doxsey#0296

[12-Jul-18 07:57 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Its fun, it could use more checkpoints tho

[12-Jul-18 07:57 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
The director went a little crazy with his ideas

[12-Jul-18 07:57 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
He needed to reel it in

[12-Jul-18 07:58 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Ok, so as of rite now

[12-Jul-18 07:58 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
We are going to Boston via train

[12-Jul-18 07:58 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I will drive us to Worcester to get on train

[12-Jul-18 07:58 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Or we can land boat

[12-Jul-18 07:58 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Ues

[12-Jul-18 07:58 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[12-Jul-18 08:00 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
If we need someone to drop us off and pick us up then we may as well go somewhere else

[12-Jul-18 08:00 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Cuz i dont wanna burden someone like that

[12-Jul-18 08:01 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
It would be wrong of us to have someone drop us off and be prepared to pick us up from the train station at the drop of a hat

[12-Jul-18 08:08 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Yo bob

[12-Jul-18 08:08 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
What do u think

[12-Jul-18 08:55 PM] fishamajig#0054
It has been seen

[12-Jul-18 08:56 PM] fishamajig#0054
Um so train is gonna be $11.50 each way per person

[12-Jul-18 08:56 PM] fishamajig#0054
Then we need about $5 each on Charlie cards for the T

[12-Jul-18 08:57 PM] fishamajig#0054
I agree getting dropped off is annoying especially since we have such a large group

[12-Jul-18 08:57 PM] fishamajig#0054
When did we decide on boston?

[12-Jul-18 08:57 PM] fishamajig#0054
I love Boston I'm just curious

[12-Jul-18 09:05 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[12-Jul-18 09:33 PM] fishamajig#0054

[15-Jul-18 01:31 PM] fishamajig#0054
What is your issue?

[15-Jul-18 01:31 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Is your semen a powder?

[15-Jul-18 01:31 PM] Will Doxsey#0296

[15-Jul-18 01:32 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
My face feels fuzzy, my eyes itch and ive been sneezing non stop

[15-Jul-18 01:32 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
My semen is bloodier than normal

[15-Jul-18 01:32 PM] fishamajig#0054
Oh yeah that sounds like an allergic reaction

[15-Jul-18 01:32 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Eat a cactus

[15-Jul-18 01:32 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
It helps

[15-Jul-18 01:32 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Get some sausage

[15-Jul-18 01:33 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Is there anything that could actually help?

[15-Jul-18 01:33 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
My cactus crops ran away

[15-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Aloe vera

[15-Jul-18 01:35 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[15-Jul-18 01:35 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[15-Jul-18 01:35 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Since Hawaiin music uses a lot of slide guitar

[15-Jul-18 01:35 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

Milk

[15-Jul-18 01:36 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Oh ok

[15-Jul-18 01:36 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
At least 2 gallons

[15-Jul-18 01:36 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Damn

[15-Jul-18 01:36 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Or u can substitute with 5lbs of almonds

[15-Jul-18 01:37 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Should I inject them whole?

[15-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Yes

[15-Jul-18 01:49 PM] fishamajig#0054
In all seriousness take some benadryl if it doesn't go away. Aloe will help if it's only skin level but it sounds like it's in you. Definitely drink tons of water

[15-Jul-18 01:50 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Ok, I just took some antacid for my stomach. I‚Äôll some aloe vera on if it still bugs my face. Idk what it was but I was sneezing like crazy but its slow down now.

[15-Jul-18 01:51 PM] fishamajig#0054
Is your stomach bothering you too?

[15-Jul-18 01:51 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Maybe its cuz I hadnt seen my cats in two days and once I came home it just hit me hard

[15-Jul-18 01:51 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
And yeah, a lil

[15-Jul-18 01:51 PM] fishamajig#0054
Maybe you're allergic to jasmine or green tea

[15-Jul-18 01:54 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Probably jasmine. Cuz ive had green tea before and felt fine. Maybe thats why my face and tongue were jittery after drinking it

[15-Jul-18 01:55 PM] fishamajig#0054
That's my guess at this point

[15-Jul-18 01:55 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I‚Äôll probably be fine or I l‚Äôll die

[15-Jul-18 01:56 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Its no big deal

[15-Jul-18 01:56 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[15-Jul-18 04:34 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Yeah

[15-Jul-18 04:34 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Could that be the allergic reaction

[15-Jul-18 04:34 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I dont think so, Im not allergic to blackberrys

[15-Jul-18 04:35 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
But it could have had something on it

[15-Jul-18 04:35 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Maybe, that could be it.

[15-Jul-18 04:35 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I feel better now. It could have had pollen on it or something

[15-Jul-18 04:36 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Yep

@joelovescash For the beginning of the video, when A Cruel Angels Thesis plays and the music begins to pick up, you should freeze frame on each of our faces and have our names appear.

Germany‚Äôs Uprising...
Th year was 2049, the day we took back our home that was once known as the ‚ÄúFatherland‚Äù. The Right-wing death squads, known as the ‚ÄúTitan Fleets‚Äù, finally began their march to take back the sacred land the enemy once gripped. The enemy wore black masks to cover their faces. The armies of the enemy consisted of muslims, obese/ugly/slampig women, and men that cut of their penises off years ago. They thought they were fighting the facists, when in reality the facists were them. The rape of Germany would finally come to an end. The first shots of the uprising took place beside the very tree where Angela Merkel and her cabinet were hung. The enemy stood no chance. The Titan Fleets showed no mercy to the enemy, for the enemy deserved none. The Titan Fleets wasted no time abolishing this once great nation of the scum that inhabited it.

Chris comes home Saturday night so he can hang out Sunday afternoon

[25-Jul-18 01:51 PM] fishamajig#0054
So someone mentioned Purgatory chasm and then a fire, we could totally do that

[25-Jul-18 01:51 PM] fishamajig#0054
I can have everyone over for a fire and overnight

[25-Jul-18 01:52 PM] fishamajig#0054
Or we can fuck around my house Saturday, have a fire, sleep over, then hike Sunday with chris

[25-Jul-18 05:43 PM] fishamajig#0054
Okay so the plan is this. Saturday we get together around lunch time. Then we do any excursions we want, be it that's e or Walmart, or a military surplus store anything. Then we go back to my house and do whatever till it gets dark, youtube, guitars, idgaf. Then we have a fire. Then we go to sleep. Then we wake up around 10 and head to Purgatory chasm where we hike and have lunch. Then we go back home and that's it

[25-Jul-18 05:44 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
This sounds nice

[25-Jul-18 05:47 PM] fishamajig#0054
We can make Purgatory chasm later in the day to cater to Chris and us sleeping in, since I think we'll all be up late/tired.

[31-Jul-18 05:55 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
The design online isnt authentic, i know what ur talking about

[31-Jul-18 05:55 PM] fishamajig#0054

[01-Aug-18 05:55 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

college humor is run by 30 year old boomers

[03-Aug-18 12:31 PM] joelovescash#8182
they were funny back in like 2012

[03-Aug-18 12:31 PM] joelovescash#8182
now its not really that good

[03-Aug-18 12:31 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Agreed

[03-Aug-18 12:31 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
They have just become out of touch, its sad really

[03-Aug-18 12:32 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
2009 was their prime year

[03-Aug-18 02:25 PM] joelovescash#8182
idk if its just placebo but it seems significantly quicker with the overclock and the ssd

[03-Aug-18 02:27 PM] fishamajig#0054
Probably placebo

[03-Aug-18 02:27 PM] joelovescash#8182
lol

[03-Aug-18 02:27 PM] joelovescash#8182
youre right

[03-Aug-18 02:27 PM] joelovescash#8182
def a waste of $100 for the ssd

[03-Aug-18 02:27 PM] joelovescash#8182
the overclock was free tho

[03-Aug-18 02:27 PM] joelovescash#8182
i shouldve done it 2 years ago lol

[03-Aug-18 02:27 PM] joelovescash#8182
idk why i didn't

[03-Aug-18 02:27 PM] joelovescash#8182
prob cuz i was scared it would blow up

[03-Aug-18 02:50 PM] fishamajig#0054
Haha I'd be scared too

[03-Aug-18 02:53 PM] joelovescash#8182
i mean the correct way to overclock is to go til it crashes to find the limit

[03-Aug-18 02:53 PM] joelovescash#8182
its sketchy

[03-Aug-18 02:53 PM] joelovescash#8182
but thats what overclocking is

[03-Aug-18 06:24 PM] fishamajig#0054
Hmm too sketch

[04-Aug-18 03:10 PM] fishamajig#0054
How's the grind

[04-Aug-18 03:10 PM] joelovescash#8182

good good

[04-Aug-18 03:12 PM] joelovescash#8182

[04-Aug-18 03:12 PM] fishamajig#0054
That's awesome

[04-Aug-18 03:12 PM] joelovescash#8182
the overclock just makes everything a little quicker

[04-Aug-18 03:12 PM] joelovescash#8182
its good

[04-Aug-18 03:12 PM] joelovescash#8182
nothing earth shattering, but a welcome boost

[04-Aug-18 03:12 PM] fishamajig#0054
Any additional speed is better than no additional speed

[04-Aug-18 03:13 PM] joelovescash#8182
facts

[04-Aug-18 03:13 PM] joelovescash#8182
im putting it thru its paced by rendering out timelapses

[04-Aug-18 03:13 PM] joelovescash#8182
thats all I've been doing

[04-Aug-18 03:13 PM] joelovescash#8182
figuring out a good longterm workflow for timelapse stuff

[04-Aug-18 03:14 PM] fishamajig#0054
How big is a given time lapse

[04-Aug-18 03:14 PM] joelovescash#8182
couple hundred pictures rn

[04-Aug-18 03:14 PM] joelovescash#8182
i haven't done anything crazy

[04-Aug-18 03:14 PM] fishamajig#0054
Like in gb

[04-Aug-18 03:14 PM] joelovescash#8182
oh you see thats where the fun begins

[04-Aug-18 03:14 PM] joelovescash#8182
each raw file is about 25MB

[04-Aug-18 03:14 PM] joelovescash#8182
which isn't too bad

[04-Aug-18 03:14 PM] fishamajig#0054
But when you have a bunch

[04-Aug-18 03:15 PM] joelovescash#8182
thats not even bad either tho

[04-Aug-18 03:15 PM] joelovescash#8182
its the next steps

[04-Aug-18 03:15 PM] joelovescash#8182
I don't wanna export and jpgs cuz you lose quality

[04-Aug-18 03:15 PM] fishamajig#0054
Yeah

[04-Aug-18 03:15 PM] joelovescash#8182
but tiffs are huge

[04-Aug-18 03:15 PM] joelovescash#8182
like 130MB per picture big

[04-Aug-18 03:15 PM] fishamajig#0054
Woah

[04-Aug-18 03:15 PM] fishamajig#0054
Wtf is a tiff

[04-Aug-18 03:16 PM] joelovescash#8182
yah so each timelapse turns into like 25-50GB

[04-Aug-18 03:16 PM] joelovescash#8182
lossless format

[04-Aug-18 03:16 PM] fishamajig#0054
Oh

[04-Aug-18 03:16 PM] joelovescash#8182
its just another option

[04-Aug-18 03:16 PM] fishamajig#0054
Is that what raw is

[04-Aug-18 03:16 PM] joelovescash#8182
dontbeafag.tiff

[04-Aug-18 03:16 PM] fishamajig#0054
Haha

[04-Aug-18 03:16 PM] joelovescash#8182
raw is just a term

[04-Aug-18 03:16 PM] fishamajig#0054
Yeah

[04-Aug-18 03:16 PM] joelovescash#8182
nah raw isn't a finished product

[04-Aug-18 03:17 PM] fishamajig#0054
And a raw file has the .tiff extension?

[04-Aug-18 03:17 PM] joelovescash#8182
no

[04-Aug-18 03:17 PM] fishamajig#0054
Oh

[04-Aug-18 03:17 PM] joelovescash#8182
each camera manufacturer has its own

[04-Aug-18 03:17 PM] joelovescash#8182
sony has .arw

[04-Aug-18 03:17 PM] joelovescash#8182
canon has .cr2

[04-Aug-18 03:17 PM] joelovescash#8182
the basic is .dng

[04-Aug-18 03:17 PM] fishamajig#0054
Oh yeah okay

[04-Aug-18 03:17 PM] joelovescash#8182
tiff is just like a jpg but no compression

[04-Aug-18 03:17 PM] joelovescash#8182
so you lose no quality

[04-Aug-18 03:18 PM] joelovescash#8182
which is what I need cuz I'm using them as an intermediate format

[04-Aug-18 03:18 PM] joelovescash#8182
its not the finished product

[04-Aug-18 03:18 PM] joelovescash#8182
Ill import the tiff sequence into premiere or after effects or something

[04-Aug-18 03:19 PM] joelovescash#8182
So my new workflow is to convert the tiff sequences into an intermediate VIDEO codec like apple prores

[04-Aug-18 03:20 PM] joelovescash#8182
now i have a video that doesn't loss much data but is still manageable

[04-Aug-18 03:20 PM] joelovescash#8182
I then delete the tiff sequence so I can save space

[04-Aug-18 03:20 PM] joelovescash#8182
The prores files still have a bitrate of like 500Mbps but its very duable

[04-Aug-18 03:21 PM] joelovescash#8182
And it can be in 4:4:4, which means no chroma subsampling

[04-Aug-18 03:21 PM] joelovescash#8182
not particularly useful for me but still nice to have

[04-Aug-18 03:21 PM] joelovescash#8182
anyway

[04-Aug-18 03:21 PM] joelovescash#8182
thats been my day so far

[04-Aug-18 03:22 PM] joelovescash#8182
rendering out raw to tiff sequences to prores files which i can then edit later into a final video in h.264, soooo an mp4

[04-Aug-18 03:22 PM] joelovescash#8182
fun stuff

[04-Aug-18 03:24 PM] fishamajig#0054
Sounds like it

[05-Aug-18 02:31 PM] fishamajig#0054

[05-Aug-18 04:09 PM] fishamajig#0054
Yo nate wanna join the illuminati with me

[05-Aug-18 04:09 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
yes

[05-Aug-18 04:09 PM] fishamajig#0054
Okay cool. Now we just need to figure out how to join

[05-Aug-18 04:10 PM] joelovescash#8182
google it

[05-Aug-18 04:10 PM] joelovescash#8182
jointheilluminati.comg

[05-Aug-18 04:10 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
we may need to convert to judism

[05-Aug-18 04:12 PM] fishamajig#0054
Okay we can't join the illuminati but we can join the freemasons

[05-Aug-18 04:12 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
that will work fine

[05-Aug-18 04:13 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
most people start out as freemasons and move to the illuminati

[05-Aug-18 04:16 PM] fishamajig#0054
Okay well we have to know a freemason in order to get in, so does anyone know someone in the freemasons?

[05-Aug-18 04:20 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
i do

[05-Aug-18 04:20 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
my sophomore year history teacher was a freemason

[05-Aug-18 04:21 PM] fishamajig#0054
Okay so they have to bring us to the masonic lodge for us to get interviewed

[05-Aug-18 04:22 PM] joelovescash#8182
how much does it cost?

[05-Aug-18 04:22 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
your soul

[05-Aug-18 04:25 PM] fishamajig#0054
It doesn't list membership fees I'll look elsewhere

[05-Aug-18 04:25 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
i think that most male freemasons get tattoos of it. its not required but its highly suggested

[05-Aug-18 04:26 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
like a tattoo of the logo

[05-Aug-18 04:29 PM] fishamajig#0054
Anywhere between 200-400 a year

[05-Aug-18 04:30 PM] joelovescash#8182

Its kinda depressing the way colleges are going in America.

[07-Aug-18 10:08 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
A high school diploma used to mean something.

[07-Aug-18 10:09 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
A high school diploma means nothing, and associates degree means nothing, soon a bachelors degree will mean nothing too.

[07-Aug-18 10:09 AM] TitaniumOx#9494

[07-Aug-18 10:18 AM] TitaniumOx#9494

Honest question, how come American based companies can go against the constitution?

[08-Aug-18 08:00 PM] fishamajig#0054
Because the government protects big corporations because they pay politicians to support their causes

[08-Aug-18 08:01 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Yeah, most of this shit goes on in blue states

[08-Aug-18 08:02 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
MA is an ok state but the liberalism here is cancer.

Prayer U comes up a lot for me

[08-Aug-18 09:39 PM] fishamajig#0054
Listen to the first 10 seconds of that video. That's the average length that a person would watch the ad before skipping

[08-Aug-18 09:40 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Prager u is actually a pretty good source of information, but it can sometimes be a little unrealistically traditional

[08-Aug-18 09:41 PM] fishamajig#0054
Like the video is actually supporting men, but the first 10-20 seconds bash men

[08-Aug-18 09:41 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

[11-Aug-18 06:51 PM] joelovescash#8182
ive been doing stuff with it since 9

[11-Aug-18 06:52 PM] fishamajig#0054
As long as we still have a viewing party over Xmas break

[11-Aug-18 06:52 PM] joelovescash#8182
oh ofc

[11-Aug-18 06:55 PM] fishamajig#0054
Yeah it'd be fine if you put it out before Xmas

[11-Aug-18 07:20 PM] joelovescash#8182
hmm the end of this video is more of a nightime driving with nate than a bitcoin boy

[11-Aug-18 07:20 PM] joelovescash#8182
whatever

[11-Aug-18 07:21 PM] joelovescash#8182
daytime driving with nate will be the prequel

[11-Aug-18 07:21 PM] joelovescash#8182
then comes bitcoin boy and nighttime driving with nate will come right after it

[11-Aug-18 07:21 PM] joelovescash#8182
but in the same video

[11-Aug-18 07:22 PM] joelovescash#8182
oh snap idea

[11-Aug-18 07:22 PM] joelovescash#8182
its a 3 part saga in one movie

[11-Aug-18 07:22 PM] joelovescash#8182
and there's a short intermission between each part

[11-Aug-18 07:22 PM] joelovescash#8182
i need some feedback

[11-Aug-18 07:23 PM] joelovescash#8182
I think that might be the best way to go

[11-Aug-18 07:23 PM] joelovescash#8182
it'll give the best experience I think... full immersion and the whole story of our day

[11-Aug-18 07:42 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
I like that idea chris

[11-Aug-18 07:44 PM] fishamajig#0054

[11-Aug-18 07:44 PM] joelovescash#8182
i already started on it

[11-Aug-18 07:44 PM] fishamajig#0054
It would have a comprehensive beginning and end

[11-Aug-18 07:44 PM] joelovescash#8182
yah there's gonna be like 2 30 sec intermissions

[11-Aug-18 07:44 PM] joelovescash#8182
yah thats what im thinking

[11-Aug-18 07:45 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Its like star wars, the first and the last movie of the OG trilogy were pretty good, but the middle film was the instant classic

M40xs

[20-Aug-18 04:18 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
The m50x s have boosted bass, an I was looking for more balanced sound

[20-Aug-18 04:58 PM] fishamajig#0054
Okay lads I'm in the market for a keyboard

[20-Aug-18 04:59 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
what is ur price range?

[20-Aug-18 05:01 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Do you want heavy switches, or light

[20-Aug-18 05:01 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
With tactile feedback or not?

[20-Aug-18 05:01 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Many wuestions

[20-Aug-18 05:13 PM] fishamajig#0054
I like my reds

[20-Aug-18 05:13 PM] fishamajig#0054
Def mech looking to spend between 100-150

[20-Aug-18 05:14 PM] fishamajig#0054
Should i just get a Logitech or razer from Walmart

[20-Aug-18 05:15 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Not razer

[20-Aug-18 05:15 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
You are looking for reds for sure tho?

[20-Aug-18 06:03 PM] fishamajig#0054
Okay no razer. They don't have to be reds, that's just what my osu keys are atm

[20-Aug-18 06:10 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
I see

[20-Aug-18 06:10 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Do you like long ones or tornument style ones?

[20-Aug-18 06:14 PM] fishamajig#0054
I don't know what that means

[20-Aug-18 06:15 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Like full number pad and arrows or cutoff for more mouse space?

[20-Aug-18 06:15 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
Like has number pad and all the other keys (maybe even some that can be programmed) or one that is shortened to be more akin to fps or something where moving mouse is preferable

[20-Aug-18 06:15 PM] fishamajig#0054
Ah well I liked having full numpad at work

[20-Aug-18 06:16 PM] fishamajig#0054
Although I like the look of a simple keyboard

[20-Aug-18 06:16 PM] fishamajig#0054
But I like the functionality of a full long keyboard

[20-Aug-18 06:22 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
What about extra function buttons?

[20-Aug-18 06:23 PM] fishamajig#0054
Sounds like a cool feature but would probably not get used a ton

[20-Aug-18 06:23 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Is the main function for everyday use or gaming?

[20-Aug-18 06:24 PM] fishamajig#0054
Everday

[20-Aug-18 06:24 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Is noise an issue?

[20-Aug-18 06:24 PM] fishamajig#0054
Nah

But I don't like super clicky keys

[20-Aug-18 06:25 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Alright

[20-Aug-18 06:26 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
I‚Äôd probably recommend browns for switches then

[20-Aug-18 06:26 PM] fishamajig#0054
Okay

[20-Aug-18 06:27 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
They are like reds, but require a little more force and have more of a bump

[20-Aug-18 06:29 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Do u care for rgb?

[20-Aug-18 06:30 PM] fishamajig#0054
No its not a necessity

[20-Aug-18 06:34 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Do u actively not want it tho?

[20-Aug-18 06:34 PM] fishamajig#0054
Nah I'm not avoiding it

[20-Aug-18 06:35 PM] joelovescash#8182
just turn it off lol

[20-Aug-18 06:35 PM] joelovescash#8182

The first one is my everyday use

[20-Aug-18 06:45 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
It‚Äôs definitely on the more professional end as opposed to like gaming look

[20-Aug-18 06:48 PM] fishamajig#0054
I kinda like the simplistic look

[20-Aug-18 06:48 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
The most utilitarian brand is das

[20-Aug-18 06:49 PM] fishamajig#0054
What do you mean utilitarian

[20-Aug-18 06:49 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Like for work not gaming will last a long time stuff

[20-Aug-18 06:49 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Pricey tho

[20-Aug-18 06:52 PM] fishamajig#0054
Ah okay

[20-Aug-18 06:53 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
For the price the Logitech Orion is best

[20-Aug-18 06:53 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

[20-Aug-18 06:54 PM] fishamajig#0054

[20-Aug-18 06:55 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Called unicomp

[20-Aug-18 06:59 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Bobby, imo a corsair with browns is a solid choice

[20-Aug-18 06:59 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
But Logitech are also worth it

[20-Aug-18 06:59 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

[20-Aug-18 06:59 PM] fishamajig#0054
I'm thinking that this keyboard should be an investment since I'll eventually have a pc

[20-Aug-18 07:00 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
A corsiar k95 woth browns is a good investment

[20-Aug-18 07:01 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
IMO

[20-Aug-18 07:01 PM] fishamajig#0054
That's $200

[20-Aug-18 07:01 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Most mechs are

[20-Aug-18 07:01 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Don‚Äôt go below 100

[20-Aug-18 07:01 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Or like close to that

Who is worst Joestar in all parts you‚Äôve read

[25-Aug-18 06:49 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
You can do worst overall (physically, stands, smarts, etc)

[25-Aug-18 06:49 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
worst as in worst written, or worst ability

[25-Aug-18 06:49 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
Worst in terms of fighting ability

[25-Aug-18 06:49 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
So combine physicality and stand uses

[25-Aug-18 06:49 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
Use hamon for Jonathon I guess

[25-Aug-18 06:50 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
probably johnathon, but it really depends on who they are fighting

[25-Aug-18 06:51 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
Ok, thank you good sir

[25-Aug-18 06:52 PM] Will Doxsey#0296
you are welcome

[25-Aug-18 06:54 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
Do you think Jonathon with Hamon could beat Joseph with Hermit Purple? Jonathon is stronger physically than Joseph, and Hermit Purple isn‚Äôt really an offensive stand

[25-Aug-18 06:55 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
it can be tho

[25-Aug-18 06:56 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
But couldn‚Äôt Hamon break through its tentacles?

[25-Aug-18 06:56 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
Or do you think Jonathons Hamon isn‚Äôt strong enough?

[25-Aug-18 06:56 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
he uses hamon too tho

[25-Aug-18 06:56 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
it wont effect him

[25-Aug-18 06:57 PM] Meany | Geoff#7397
So Jonathon wouldn‚Äôt be able to rip apart the tentacles at all then?

[25-Aug-18 07:01 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
idk

[25-Aug-18 07:01 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
it also depends if it is a strait up fight

[25-Aug-18 07:02 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
hermit can give mobility in certain places

[26-Aug-18 04:34 PM] fishamajig#0054
Its violent video games like this that turn kids into mass shooters

[26-Aug-18 04:34 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
that black guy in the background wouldnt shut up

[26-Aug-18 04:35 PM] fishamajig#0054
They just love talking

[27-Aug-18 05:45 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
Should we really count the dead shooter in a mass shooting?

[27-Aug-18 01:29 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Only if he shoots himself

[27-Aug-18 01:29 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Suicide by cop doesn‚Äôt count

[27-Aug-18 01:30 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
Yeah but if he shoots himself, its not like he is a victim. The people that died unwillingly are more the victims of the shooting. Idk

[27-Aug-18 01:56 PM] fishamajig#0054
He was still a victim to his actions like the other people. But you're right that he isn't a "victim" since he took his own life

I had a wicked weird dream

[01-Sep-18 11:20 AM] fishamajig#0054
So did I actually. You go first

[01-Sep-18 11:22 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
I had two of 'em. Both had my father in 'em. It's peculiar. I'm older now then he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember too well but it was about meeting him in town somewhere, he's gonna give me some money. I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night. Goin' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on goin'. Never said nothin' goin' by. He just rode on past... and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. 'Bout the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was goin' on ahead and he was fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up...

[01-Sep-18 11:26 AM] fishamajig#0054
Woah

[01-Sep-18 11:29 AM] fishamajig#0054
My dream was weird. I don't remember it all, but I was in a house with my family. But it wasn't my house. There was some kind of presence that was bad, I can't remember if it was a physical being or not, but I think it was  a monster or bad person. Well anyway I either killed my dad and sister or the evil being did, and I was left with just my mom in this house. I remember feeling guilt for my dad and sisters death but don't remember killing them with my own hand

[01-Sep-18 11:34 AM] TitaniumOx#9494

[06-Sep-18 09:47 AM] fishamajig#0054
Why would he diss die antwoord

[06-Sep-18 09:48 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
I honestly dont really know, from what ive seen DA said something about him that was pretty tame but he took it way to serious

[06-Sep-18 09:49 AM] fishamajig#0054
He needs the publicity that only stupid drama can get you

[06-Sep-18 09:50 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
Yeah pretty much

[06-Sep-18 09:52 AM] TitaniumOx#9494
Ever since Eminem did that trump diss his career has been going downhill

[12-Sep-18 08:42 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
Good album

[12-Sep-18 08:43 AM] fishamajig#0054

The Florida tech anime Club is honestly pretty fun

[12-Sep-18 10:06 AM] fishamajig#0054
That's what got me into this shit

[12-Sep-18 10:06 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
Cool

[12-Sep-18 10:06 AM] DylanDoxsey#0117
What do they do?

[12-Sep-18 10:08 AM] fishamajig#0054
Every Thursday they meet. Each week is a theme, and we just watch animes in that theme. For example, slice of life was a theme. Every other Saturday is a marathon from 12-10 where you go to a huge lecture hall with a big ass projector and watch anime

[12-Sep-18 10:08 AM] fishamajig#0054
And then there's trips like last weekend and this weekend to things like cons and shows

[12-Sep-18 10:10 AM] fishamajig#0054
I also get access to an extensive library of manga

bobby could you do me a questionable favor?

[12-Sep-18 02:53 PM] fishamajig#0054
Possibly

[12-Sep-18 03:00 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
can you think of any modifications for a telecaster that you like?

[12-Sep-18 03:00 PM] fishamajig#0054
Why is that questionable?

[12-Sep-18 03:01 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
idk, i guess cuz its very specific and it requires searching around

[12-Sep-18 03:01 PM] fishamajig#0054
Like a body mod?

[12-Sep-18 03:01 PM] fishamajig#0054
Or hardware?

[12-Sep-18 03:01 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
both really

[12-Sep-18 03:02 PM] fishamajig#0054
It would be cool to take the electronics and put them In something else

[12-Sep-18 03:02 PM] fishamajig#0054
Like change out the main body for something else entirely

[12-Sep-18 03:16 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
like adding humbuckers

[12-Sep-18 03:22 PM] fishamajig#0054
What if you had 2 sets of pickups and each one went to a separate amp

[12-Sep-18 03:22 PM] fishamajig#0054
And then you could distort each one with a different pedal

[12-Sep-18 03:23 PM] TitaniumOx#9494

[14-Sep-18 09:55 AM] fishamajig#0054

[14-Sep-18 09:56 AM] fishamajig#0054
Those are the characters right

[14-Sep-18 09:56 AM] fishamajig#0054
Isn't there hirigana, katagana, and a third one

[14-Sep-18 09:57 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
Kanji

[14-Sep-18 09:57 AM] fishamajig#0054
Oh yeah

[14-Sep-18 09:57 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
There are 87 hiragana 87 katakana, and around 8000 kanji

[14-Sep-18 09:57 AM] fishamajig#0054
Oh fuck kanji

[14-Sep-18 09:59 AM] Will Doxsey#0296

[14-Sep-18 10:02 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
It's confusing when to use

[14-Sep-18 10:02 AM] Will Doxsey#0296
I think most nouns and verbs are kanji

[23-Sep-18 04:16 PM] fishamajig#0054
friend is getting rid of msi gs63vr 6rf stealth pro gaming laptop. thing runs horribly slow, needs new hdd or ssd (disk always at 100%) Should I buy it for like $500 and put a new ssd in which will make it run perfectly? already looked online and most people are saying this worked for them. Then its a question of whether or not i want linux or windows. i wanna play osu on it so that needs windows atm. how would i go about getting a portable windows boot?

[23-Sep-18 05:11 PM] fishamajig#0054
would a 2.5" ssd be better or a m.2 ssd? theyre the same price for 1tb and the laptop takes both

[23-Sep-18 09:23 PM] fishamajig#0054
finally clicking some circles

For playtime

[25-Oct-18 04:29 PM] Miles#3711
On Yakuza 0

[25-Oct-18 04:29 PM] DylanDoxsey#0117

40-140

you could either fly into melbourne or orlando

[03-Nov-18 12:07 AM] joelovescash#8182
which is typically cheaper tho

[03-Nov-18 12:07 AM] joelovescash#8182
orlando is pretty touristy

[03-Nov-18 12:07 AM] fishamajig#0054
well orlando has more flights to it, but then you gotta drive an hour

[03-Nov-18 12:08 AM] joelovescash#8182
tru

[03-Nov-18 12:09 AM] joelovescash#8182
cheapest im finding is 112

[03-Nov-18 12:09 AM] joelovescash#8182

[03-Nov-18 12:09 AM] fishamajig#0054
thats a lot

[03-Nov-18 12:09 AM] joelovescash#8182
depends on your mileage

[03-Nov-18 12:09 AM] joelovescash#8182

An interview came out yesterday of Sam Hyde saying that both him, Nick, and Charles are down to making skits again. Nick just needs to settle into his new job and Charles just needs to finish moving.

pcs are trash

lol you need a pc to run that too

[03-Nov-18 11:57 PM] joelovescash#8182
no chance you'll run anything at 240 with what you got  rn

[03-Nov-18 11:58 PM] fishamajig#0054
not just a laptop to plug into?

[03-Nov-18 11:58 PM] fishamajig#0054

[03-Nov-18 11:59 PM] joelovescash#8182

[03-Nov-18 11:59 PM] joelovescash#8182

[03-Nov-18 11:59 PM] fishamajig#0054
perhaps in another life

[03-Nov-18 11:59 PM] joelovescash#8182
you can get at least 75 fps at max setting prob

[04-Nov-18 12:00 AM] joelovescash#8182
240hz is crazy high

[04-Nov-18 12:00 AM] fishamajig#0054
thats true

[04-Nov-18 12:00 AM] joelovescash#8182
there's no point for me to have it

[04-Nov-18 12:01 AM] fishamajig#0054
oh gotcha

[04-Nov-18 12:01 AM] joelovescash#8182
240 is overkill unless you play consistent comp

[04-Nov-18 12:01 AM] fishamajig#0054
yeah i dont have time to play comp

[04-Nov-18 12:01 AM] fishamajig#0054

[04-Nov-18 12:02 AM] fishamajig#0054
good question

[04-Nov-18 12:02 AM] joelovescash#8182
i dont think there is anything between 16:9 and 21:9

[04-Nov-18 12:03 AM] joelovescash#8182
besides 16:10 and thats a niche ratio

[04-Nov-18 12:03 AM] fishamajig#0054
idk how to find that info

[04-Nov-18 12:03 AM] joelovescash#8182

[08-Nov-18 12:58 PM] fishamajig#0054
That's such a weak response to losing. Blaming it on racism and making everyone go through trouble just because you lost

[08-Nov-18 12:58 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
ikr

[08-Nov-18 12:59 PM] TitaniumOx#9494
if she had any sort of leadership qualities, she would accept defeat with respect

[08-Nov-18 03:53 PM] fishamajig#0054
I was thinking we could go to disney, Kennedy space center, the beach, Myrtle Beach, South of the border, DC, any big city (Baltimore, Atlanta, NYC), and then find tourist shit to see along the way

[17-Nov-18 07:35 PM] joelovescash#8182
oil or alcohol of some sort

[17-Nov-18 07:35 PM] fishamajig#0054
Don't get drunk and play with fire

[17-Nov-18 07:35 PM] joelovescash#8182

[17-Nov-18 07:35 PM] fishamajig#0054
Good man

[17-Nov-18 07:35 PM] joelovescash#8182

[17-Nov-18 07:40 PM] joelovescash#8182
alcohol is just way more flammable

[17-Nov-18 07:40 PM] joelovescash#8182
you can burn yourself way easier

[17-Nov-18 07:40 PM] joelovescash#8182
paraffin oil is really only flammable in a vapor

[17-Nov-18 07:41 PM] joelovescash#8182

[17-Nov-18 07:41 PM] fishamajig#0054
Most oil is only flammable when dispersed like that
